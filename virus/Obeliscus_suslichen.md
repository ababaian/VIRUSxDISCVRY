### {Obeliscus suslichen}
*{Obeliscus - latin for Obelisk (presence of oblin proteins coded for by the ORFs as well as other features later described in the paper align with obelisks). Sus - latin for pig (this obelisk is found in pig gut metagenomes), Lichen - this obelisk is strongly associated with a lichen species which is likely its host.}*

## Abstract

{Obelisks are a new and exciting discovery of RNA viroid-like elements found scattered in global microbiomes [Zheludev et al. 2024] as a result of mass metatrascriptomic database analysis. This discovery came with thousands of novel, uncharacterized obelisks full of intriguing questions. One such Obelisk is explored in this paper - Obeliscus suslichen. This obelisk was found associated with 3 different BioProjects - all of which will be discussed and prodded for information below. The BioProjects reveal important ecological context to Obeliscus suslichen with ideal environment (anaerobic pig gut metagenomes) and potential host species (the lichen Rinodina peloleuca) all playing an important role in its characterization. Further analyses conducted using sequence alignment tools, database searches and protein structure generation answer some questions, but bring up even more about host-relationship and what domains are relevant for Obelisks. This paper will explore these answers and questions with an emphasis on the need for further studies to be conducted on each unknown Obelisk so the resulting classifcation is of high-confidence.}

## Results

### Ecology subsection A...

{Known Appearances 
Obeliscus suslichen has appeared across 10 libraries in 3 BioProjects to date: let's call them 'Pig' (BioProject 1), 'Sludge' (BioProject 2) and 'Lichen' (BioProject 3). Let's explore how these 3 BioProjects reveal unique aspects of Obeliscus suslichen that blend together to form a clearer picture of its ecology. 

'Pig' (BioProject 1)
'Pig' and its associated data can be found from searching the NCBI BioProject database with the its Accession: PRJNA716119. This BioProject had 2 publications associated with it: [Chen et al. 2022] and [Sadiq et al. 2022]. Chen et al. focused on analyzing RNA viromes from various ecotypes such as soil and water sediments and animal faeces across different locations in China. Metatranscriptomic methods and RNA sequencing were conducted on these samples and revealed novel viral genomes including our Obeliscus suslichen sequence which was obtained from a pig faeces sample in the Heilongjiang province of China and associated with the gut metagenome. Sadiq et al. used the dataset from Chen et al. in their paper which investigated evolutionary relationships in Lenarviricota (a phylum of RNA viruses which encode for RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) protein and were first discovered in fungal hosts) [Sadiq et al. 2022]. This data from 'Pig' alone is not enough for us to generate a clear hypothesis for characterizing Obeliscus suslichen so exploration of the remaining BioProjects is necessary. 

'Sludge' (BioProject 2)
'Sludge' and its associated data can be found from searching the NCBI BioProject database with its Accession: PRJNA729609. 'Sludge' had no publications associated with it but showed a description stating that it was a Chinese study that focused on macro trancriptional analysis of fluid sludge found on anaerobic digestion experimental groups. Without additional data to explore, it is difficult to infer the exact source of Obeliscus suslichen in 'Sludge' as it does not state anything more about the biosample than the fact that it associated with the sludge metagenome. However, despite the limited information provided, we can gain valuable insight about the environment in which Obeliscus suslichen operates: anaerobic. This, combining with information from 'Pig', can help confirm that Obeliscus suslichen operates in the gut metagenome which is known to be an anaerobic environment [Maier. 2014]. 

'Lichen' (BioProject 3)
'Lichen' and its associated data can be found from searching the NCBI BioProject database with its Accession: PRJEB48889. 'Lichen' also had no publications associated with it, but had a detailed description of what the project entailed: it was also a metatranscriptomic analysis of gut microbiota in minipigs native to China to observe effects of these microbiota on a cardiovascular disease called atherothrombosis. All biosamples of Obeliscus suslichen in 'Lichen' were obtained from rectum, cecum, or colon samples of the pigs and were associated with the organism Rinodina peloleuca. Rinodina peloleuca is an aquatic lichen [Matzer. 1998] which are dual organisms of fungi and algae in a symbiotic relationship [Brodo. 2024]. 7 out of the 10 samples of Obeliscus suslichen were associated with Rinodina peloleuca so this, and the data from Sadiq et al. in 'Pig' which showed an association to fungal hosts - lichens contian fungi , strengthen the relationship between Obeliscus suslichen and a lichen host - Rinodina peloleuca. 

Putting it All Together
'Pig', 'Lichen' and 'Sludge' all gave us different glimpses into Obeliscus suslichen and its ecology with common factors: Obeliscus suslichen is only detected in China to date, is strongly associated with pig gut metagenomes, is likely to use the fungus Rinodina peloleuca as its host. Putting all this infformation together allows us to form a tentative hypothesis: Obeliscus suslichen is a novel Obelisk species that colonizes pig gut microbiomes using the lichen species Rinodina peloleuca as its host organism. 

Further Analyses
Obeliscus suslichen is completely uncharacterized which means we had to conduct further analyses of its sequence to confirm conclusions that were used to derive our tentative hypothesis. The first step was finding conserved regions in the 10 samples of Obeliscus suslichen which was acheived by multiple sequnece alignment of the 10 sequences by the Clustal Omega tool in the MPI Bioinformatics toolkit. The conserved sequence alignemnt [consseq in data/] was then selected for regions of >80% similarity using MEGA and the resulting FASTA sequnece was analyzed using the NCBI Conserved Domain Database to identify any RdRp or other viral domains but no hits were found. This result shows that Obeliscus suslichen is a completely novel species and the lack of RdRp-coding domains shows that it is not a RNA virus capable of replicating on its own - it is another piece of evidence confirming that Obeliscus suslichen is instead an obelisk which is a viroid-like element dependent on a host for replication mechanisms [Zheludev et al. 2024]. 

Now that Obeliscus suslichen showed reliability on a host, we conducted additional analyses to try and confirm a relationship to its hypothesized lichen host Rinodina peloleuca. Rinodina peloleuca was already shown to be found with Obeliscus suslichen in 70% of its samples, but a confirmed association was still lacking. To try and show this association, the NCBI Nucleotide database was searched for Rinodina peloleuca genome but only one result of a partial sequence came up. Due to a lack of sufficient information, focus was shifted instead to the Obeliscus suslichen sequence itself and it was entered into the NCBI Conserved Domain Database to determine if any known fungal-interactig domains were found. Once again, there were no hits - even when the search was refined to include the 'Rinodina' taxa. It is important to note that this does not disprove the hypothesis stating Rinodina peloleuca as a host for Obeliscus suslichen - it only fails to confirm it. These analyses may not have resulted in a fruitful result, but are still vital to further our understanding of Obeliscus suslichen and will be elaborated on in the 'Discussion' section.}

### Virus Genome {Q3}

![Figure 1 - Obeliscus suslichen Genome](virus/img/obeliscus_suslichen/fig1.png)

Figure 1: Obeliscus suslichen genome visualization generated in Geneious Prime. (A) Circular genome 1037 nucleotides long showing six annotated ORFs done using built-in Geneious Prime software (parameters for ORF identification were at least 75 nucleotides length and start codon ATG). (B) Linear view of all six ORFs along the genome to easily interpret the nucleotide positions and amino acid lengths of each ORF. Scale bar for (A) and (B) depicts nucleotide numbering on the outer bar and amino acid numbering on the inner bar. (C) Structure of Obeliscus suslichen genome visualized using AlphaFold 3 and shows a rod-like secondary structure typical of Obelisks [Zheludev et al. 2024], color orange indicates low-confidence structure. Note: Geneious Prime conducted database searches for conserved domains and viral contigs but no matches for either were found.
Additional Note: de novo assembly using Geneious Prime was performed on the contigs from which this sequence was generated, but resulted in 5 separate contig assemblies with little coverage and read depth so analysis was not done on those contigs.


## Discussion

{Obeliscus suslichen is a potential novel Obelisk species local to China. It has similar features to other Obelisks with its circular genome, and predicted rod-like secondary structure. It showed no conserved domains typical of RNA viruses like RdRp which aligns with obelisks which use host machinery to operate. However, it also did not show any other viral-like conserved domains typical in viroid-like organisms which further pushes the question of whether or not Obeliscus suslichen should be characterized as an Obelisk at all. There were interesting ecological features of Obeliscus suslichen uncovered through data analysis of its associated BioProjects which were discussed earlier. Most notably, it was exclusive to China, showed strong associations to funal like hosts - particularly the lichen Rinidina peloleuca, and was found in gut metagenomes of pigs. However, once again, the multiple sequence alignments generated did not show conclusive results that could confirm the host-obelisk relationship between Obeliscus suslichen and Rinodina peloleuca. An interesting discovery was made while searching the NCBI database for Rinodina peloleuca sequneces - although this particular species is not fully sequences, other members of the same taxa were available for reference. Even though Obeliscus suslichen is not known to be associated with these other species, it further adds to the countless possibilities available for future research on this and other novel obelisks found.  The lack of sequencing data available for the candidate host species which emphasizes the importance of characterizing related species genomes along with the Obelisk in question's genome to obtain a clear and exact result. The only high-confidence conclusions this paper offers are direct sequence facts such as GC % concentration and sequence length. 

Despite the unclear results produced, the presence of ORF 3 and ORF 1 are very promising. ORF 3 resulted in a Oblin-1-like protein and ORF 1 resulted in a Oblin-2-like protein which strengthen the argument that Obeliscus suslichen is indeed an Obelisk species. However, the presence of these proteins are not nearly enough to confidently conclude the characterization of Obeliscus suslichen. The hypothesis generated from all this information still remains to be answered - is Obeliscus suslichen a novel Obelisk species in pig metagenomes that utilizes Rinodina peloleuca as its host? The main takeaway from this data exploration journey is that there is always more to learn - answering this hypothesis will require more knowledge about Rinidina peloleuca, about the unknown domains in the Obeliscus suslichen genome which show no matches to conserved databases, and about the mechanisms by which Obeliscus suslichen operates. This paper might not have conclusive answers to these questions but it has provided new biological insights about Obeliscus suslichen itself such as its ideal environment likely being anaerobic to match the environment of the pig gut metagenomes where it is found as well as its association with hosts similar to, if not exactly, Rinodina peloleuca. 

The lack of conserved viral-like domains found in the genome begs another interesting question - is Obeliscus suslichen an Obelisk or another entity all together? Is it a completely new species which not only relies on host RNA replication machinery but all of the hosts machinery? Is the characterization of Obelisks as RNA  viroid-like organisms too narrow? Only more studies will be able to answer these intriguing questions.}

# Viral Short Story

```
A mysterious monster lurks in the depths of China. Seemingly harmless, it slips undetected into the country water with the intention to infect every unsuspecting living thing in sight. Nobody knows what it is and every second spent in the unknown is another second spent shaking in terror not knowing how far the monster has extended its evil reach. The attacks show no rhyme or reason as the monster siezes the insides of swine across the country threatening to spread its plague to the masses. Nowhere is safe - local lakes once used as picnic spots are now deserted out of fear that it lurks below, markets once so lively are now abandoned by the threat of contaminated meat - the whole country has gone into lockdown. There is something so scary about a monster with no name and no motive - it just destroys for the sake of destruction It is impossible to fight against something without knowing what weapon to use. The key to defeating this monster is idetifying this weapon and the only one equipped to complete such a task is a scientist. This realization hits you months into the monster's reign of terror and comes in the form of inspiration. You collect samples of this monster wherever sightings were reported and log all the details about the sample origins. You sequence each sample and the consensus sequence shows hits in RNA virome databases - now you know the monster is even more dangerous than anticipated. The monster does not care that there is a scientist trying to stop it - it continues plaguing the country and defeat seems imminient. The rest of the world clsoes its borders in fear that the monster will reach them too. Accompanied only by the terrifying sound of silence, you work tirelessly to find answers. Ping! Your computer breaks the silence and shows a hit in the 2237th sample - a lichen called Rinodina peloleuca is the common factor in your samples. It seems the monster cannot function without it. You give the scary unknown a name: Obelisk 2237. Now there's a target to fight against - time to choose a weapon.
