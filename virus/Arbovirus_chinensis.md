# An ugly bug in beautiful bugs, one novel Orthomyxoviridae virus identified in China
written by: Nuan Wen

### Arbovirus chinensis
*The genus name "Arbovirus" indicates an arthropod-borne virus since I propose it is a virus transmitted between arthropods. The species name "chinensis," suggesting an association with China since it is mostly found in species endemic to China.*

## Abstract
```
During our investigation into virus discovery within the Orthomyxoviridae family, we uncovered a unique viral entity, Arbovirus chinensis, with a broad host range, spanning insects such as Luehdorfia chinensis and Ceracris kiangsu to the mammalian Mus musculus and Meganola albula. The datasets, each serving distinct research objectives, illuminate the prevalence of this virus, particularly in endangered species, raising significant conservation concerns. Our work sheds light on the intricate ecological dynamics of this novel virus, emphasizing the need for ongoing research efforts and collaborative initiatives to comprehend the broader implications for biodiversity and ecosystems. This discovery carries substantial implications for virologists, ecologists, and conservationists alike, urging a multidisciplinary approach to tackle emerging viral threats.

### Comparative Analysis of Host Ecology

```
Luehdorfia chinensis and Luehdorfia taibai, both endemic to China, share striking similarities in their habitats, behaviors, and appearances. Primarily inhabiting the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the Qinling Mountains, these species remain poorly understood and are classified as endangered [Guan et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 1998]. Their group-oriented daytime activity is a notable trait, and they primarily feed on dandelions, purpurea, and other viola plants [Yuan et al., 1998].

Ceracris kiangsu, also known as the yellow-spined bamboo locust, is another exclusive Chinese species. Distributed in the southern region of the Yangtze River, this locust significantly impacts bamboo production by feeding on bamboo leaves. Natural predators, including birds, lizards, and mice, contribute to its ecological dynamics. Notably, it exhibits aggregation behavior near human urine-contaminated food due to the strong phagostimulant NaCl and attractant NH4HCO3 [Yu et al., 2011].

Mus musculus, commonly known as the house mouse, belongs to the Rodidae family and is globally distributed, including throughout China. As an omnivore, it consumes seeds, fruits, vegetables, and insects in the wild, with a nocturnal activity pattern. Its role as a carrier of various disease agents is well-documented [Baidu, n.d.].

Meganola albula, or Kent Black Arches, spans the Palearctic region, extending into eastern China, specifically Jiangxi and Sichuan provinces, situated in the middle of the Yangtze River [Boyes et al., 1775; Baidu, n.d.].

The overlapping habitat near the Yangtze River suggests a potential avenue for virus transmission among these species, reflected in the shared presence of the RdRp sequence. The virus discovered may be an insect virus capable of infecting L. chinensis, Luehdorfia taibai, C. kiangsu, and M. albula, all of which are within the ecological range of M. musculus. This ecological connection could explain the presence of the virus in samples from these diverse species. However, the varying activity times—some species being diurnal and others nocturnal—may limit the extent of potential virus transmission due to differences in their active periods.

## Discussion
```
Our investigation into the prevalence of A. chinensis across diverse host species highlights the intricate dynamics within the Orthomyxoviridae family. The presence of A. chinensis in datasets featuring a range of hosts, from insects like Luehdorfia chinensis and Ceracris kiangsu to the mammalian Mus musculus, underscores its potential for broad host range. The distinct datasets, each serving specific research objectives, contribute to our understanding of the distribution and ecological implications of A. chinensis.

Comparative analyses of host ecology reveal unique patterns, with species like Luehdorfia chinensis and Ceracris kiangsu showcasing specific habitat preferences and feeding behaviors. The overlapping habitat near the Yangtze River suggests potential avenues for transmission among these diverse species. However, the varying activity times of these hosts may influence the extent of potential virus transmission.

Classified within the Orthomyxoviridae family, A. chinensis exhibits typical characteristics of this viral group, with a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome and the presence of key proteins like RdRp, nucleoprotein, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase. Notably, its ability to infect both vertebrates and invertebrates adds a layer of complexity to its ecology.

Conservation concerns arise from the presence of A. chinensis in endangered species, emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and collaborative research efforts. The potential impact on biodiversity and ecosystems underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving virologists, ecologists, and conservationists.

In conclusion, our study provides insights into the multifaceted interactions between A. chinensis, its diverse host species, and the broader ecological landscape. The unique characteristics of the Orthomyxoviridae family and the distinct clade of A. chinensis highlight the ongoing need for research and conservation efforts, especially in the context of endangered species and the potential implications for ecosystems.

# Viral Short Story

```
In the quiet province of Jiangsu, China, a sinister discovery unfolded at the hands of researchers from NJNU in 2015. The dataset, a transcriptome analysis of the main sensory organs of the endangered butterfly species Luehdorfia chinensis, held secrets that transcended the boundaries of scientific inquiry. As the researchers delved into the intricacies of the butterfly's RNA-seq data, they stumbled upon a hidden entity, a viral sequence that defied classification and **haunted their data collection in 2015**. 

The RdRp sequence, the molecular fingerprint of the enigmatic virus, **bore an uncanny resemblance to known butterfly viruses but displayed a mere 60% identity**. This led to a perplexing revelation – a divergence substantial enough to rule out technical errors, suggesting that **a novel virus had infiltrated the delicate genetic makeup of the Luehdorfia chinensis**.

As the investigators initiated a detective-like pursuit, a series of unsettling questions arose. Why did the GenBank BLAST results link the virus to Mus musculus, the common house mouse, and Brenthis ino, a butterfly of the Nymphalidae family? The answer unfolded in a chilling narrative: the virus, having infected the butterflies, found an unexpected ally in **the mice that preyed upon them**, creating an unholy alliance between species.

The absence of a publication surrounding the dataset deepened the mystery. A hypothesis emerged that the university's motive transcended individual recognition, driven by a commitment to environmental conservation. In a world where endangered butterfly species faced an existential threat, the NJNU researchers might have sought to provide an open resource for the global scientific community to aid in the preservation effort.

In the eerie silence of the laboratory, another enigma presented itself – the recurring palm motif within the transcript.fasta file. Was it a mere artifact of repeated motifs in the RdRp sequence, or did it signify a more ominous presence, echoing through multiple reads like a haunting refrain?

The end of 2015 marked the submission of the dataset to NCBI, freezing in time a chapter of scientific intrigue. Little did the world know that within the RNA-seq data of Luehdorfia chinensis lurked a viral horror, **a biological enigma that transcended species, weaving a tale of ecological disruption and a silent, creeping apocalypse**.
