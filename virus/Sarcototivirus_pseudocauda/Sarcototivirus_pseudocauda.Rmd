At the dawn of the Molecular Genetics, Max Delbruck led a loose collection of
geneticists known as the "Phage Group". They were amongst the first to pick up
the reciever when the Molecular Revolution was calling. They had two unifying
philosophies:

(1) Hard Physics-style Scientific Inquiry
(2) They studied viruses, because that's the simplest model organism to do
    cool science in.
    
Computational Biology is having that kind of moment today. And the way to 
realize the Computational Revolution of biology is by choosing a strong model;
Viruses and Virus-like Agents!

## Learner Objectives
```
By the end of this assignment, you will have taken the plunge into a real
research problem, there is risk and no certainty of "success", but as the old
saying goes, "If you can't fatally kill your hypothesis, then it was never alive
to begin with." Risk begets Reward.

It is up to you to find and guide the direction of the project, these questions
only give you a generic scaffold. As such, (and with the bonus marks) it will
be possible to do a technically good job and you'll do fine on the assignment.

A subset of you will rise to the occasion and knock it out of the park, that 
will reflect the 99% grades. If you earn 99% on this final, consider it a formal
job offer to join the RNAlab for the summer.

If you do an exceptional on this project and uncover something worth publishing,
I will encourage you to pursue it and go through with a publication.

Remember, you're a scientist if you choose to be.
```

## Assignment Objectives
```
For this project you're going to compile all the components for a short
"Genome Announcement" style scientific report, describing the RNA virome
of a species which you have been randomized. You do not need to re-write the
answers into a seperate paper, this assignment serves as the paper/methods 
template. You will know by the end if it's worth formalizing. In addition you
are to prepare a 6 minute video  presentation summarizing your work.

The goal here is *Data Exploration*, you are not expected to have every analysis
work and be super insightful, instead you will be graded on rationale, creativity
technical execution, and presentation of your analysis. Outcome does not affect
grade. 

Most analyses will be difficult or impossible to interpret, the fun part of
science  is we can't always know the difference. If you are able to
justify (hypothesis) the reason you performed a given analysis, and it's
inconclusive, you will recieve full marks for trying. You will be deducted (few)
marks if you include an analysis and it's not justified, or if you misinterpret
the analysis results. The _most common_ error is not justifying your conclusions
with reported data, or over-claiming conclusions. Be precise, be specific, and 
back up your statements with data! This is the feedback/learning mechanism of
peer review, it will guide you in the future.

Please include in the work when you judge you can make a *low*, *moderate* or
*high*  confidence conclusion. Also state if your results are inconclusive.
```


## Logistics
```
Inclusive in this document should be all supporting code, scripts, and/or 
software settings used to answer any questions in the assignment. If you use or
generate a data-object, such as .fasta, .pdb, .sto, .csv, etc..., include this
in your submission repository.

For Written portions please use block text like this and you can include 
references simply as square brackets [Babaian. 1989], with a references section
at the end.
```

## Virus Assignment
```
You are randomly assigned a Virus. 

## `data/virusAssignments.csv` 
  Gives the assignment of your virus. Each virus has a unique identifier (sOTU)
  as well as some summary statistics about where this virus was "found" in the
  SRA. You're also given a link to the assembly file from the "index run" which
  should contain your virus sequence.

## `data/virusRunObservations.csv`
  This file  contains a list of all SRA "runs" in which these  viruses were 
  reliably detected. You can use the sOTU identifier to get an  estimate overview
  for your virus. The final column in this file contains the  barcode sequence
  detected in that particular run.

# ==============================================================================

## Question 1 : Framing the story `(10 points)` --------------------------------
**Q.** `(1 point)` Write a title for your paper which describes your key finding.

**A.** Tail of Two Hosts: Tracing a Cryptic Totiviridae-Associated Virus in Bovine Muscle Transcriptomes

**Q.** `(bonus point)` Include a pun in your title which relates to a theme or motif
used throughout your paper.

**A.** The title "Tail of Two Hosts" is a play on Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, where: 
- 'Tail': refers to the central technical paradox of the study: the recovery of a "tailless" dsRNA virus from a Poly-A "tailed" library
- 'Two Hosts': refers to the biological conflict between the metadata host (Bos grunniens) and the true biological host (Sarcocystis), distinguishing the "vessel" from the "infection".

**Q.** `(1 point)` Give your virus a latin binomial name, and explain the etiology
of the name and how it relates to the story of your virus.

**A.** I propose the name *Sarcototivirus pseudocauda*.
Genus: *Sarcototivirus*
1. Derived from “Sarco” (Greek sarx for flesh/muscle), referencing both the isolation source, i.e. striated bovine muscle and the presumed protozoan host genus, *Sarcocystis*.
2. "Totivirus" places it within its correct taxonomic family (Totiviridae).
Species: *pseudocauda*
1. Derived from "pseudo" (Greek for false) + "cauda" (Latin for tail).
2. The name refers to the inferred mechanism by which the virus was detected. Totiviridae genomes are non-polyadenylated dsRNA and are not expected to be recovered from poly-A–enriched RNA-seq libraries; however, the recovered contig contains short internal A-rich regions. This supports the hypothesis that the virus entered the sequencing library through non-canonical oligo-dT priming rather than true polyadenylation.


**Q.** `(8 points)` For any given paper, 90% of the readership will only read your
abstract. How many people go on to read the rest of your paper will depend
on your ability to capture peoples interest in the abstract. (hint: write the
abstract last)

Read *How to Construct a Nature summary paragraph* and write a short abstract
closely following this structure. Max 300 words.

Link: https://www.nature.com/documents/nature-summary-paragraph.pdf

**A.** Public nucleotide archives contain vast repositories of host-derived RNA sequencing data that remain largely unexplored for commensal or parasitic viral signatures. Standard eukaryotic mRNA sequencing protocols frequently utilize poly-A enrichment to capture coding transcripts, a process assumed to exclude non-polyadenylated lineages such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses of the family Totiviridae. However, it remains unclear to what extent this exclusion is absolute, or if specific biochemical mechanisms allow "tailless" viral RNA to bypass selection and appear as authentic signals in host datasets. Here, I characterize the ecology and capture mechanism of sOTU u145189, a cryptic Totiviridae-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase recovered from Bos grunniens (Yak) muscle transcriptomes. The viral signal was found to be predominant in striated muscle across 15 sequencing runs, while phylogenetic analysis places it with Eimeria-associated viruses (~61% amino acid identity), contradicting a direct bovine infection model. Forensic sequence analysis shows that although the virus lacks a true poly-A tail, it contains several short adenosine-rich regions (AAAA) that could enable incidental capture during oligo-dT–based library preparation. I therefore propose that u145189 represents a "passenger" virus of the muscle-encysting apicomplexan *Sarcocystis*, unmasked during host library preparation. Consequently, this study demonstrates that technical artifacts in library preparation can be leveraged as forensic tools, transforming archived host transcriptomes into unanticipated resources for surveying cryptic microbiological ecosystems. 

## Question 2 : Digital Ecology  `(20 points)` ---------------------------------

In brief, ecology is the relationship of an organism to biotic and abiotic
factors. Consider the sample source for this virus and describe the specifics
(e.g. run accessions, study authors, associated species, ...) and generics 
(e.g. type of ecosystem, country/continent, common associated host class like
Mammals).

All viruses occur in more than one dataset (SRA run), compare and contrast
the ecology of your index case, and the broader ecology of all virus-containing
datasets. What commonalities, if any, emerge?

Organize your answer in notes and ideas into at two or three topic sub-sections,
with a heading for each. This will form the "body" of your story. For
each sub-heading, develop a logical progression of notes or short sentences.

This should be methodology oriented, explain the details of what and how you
performed the analysis, linking logical ideas together. If you ran any program
with a non-standard parameter, be sure to include that information.

Guiding questions:
- Is there an associated publication with your index case?
- How many different "bioProjects" does your virus land in? Are there more
  publications describing those?
- Which dataset(s) is the virus found in?
- How does this observation compare to the "expected" niche of related viruses?
- What is the origin(s) of these dataset(s), technology and biology.
- Can you observe a common factor which links these datasets together and
  may explain the presence of the virus?
- How can you measure and quantify your observations. More importantly, how do 
  you translate this into a hypothesis?

# Example Answer
**Identification of a T. gondii-associated viral sequence**

Using SerratusSQL to screen for novel human neuroinflammatory RNA viruses, 
we searched the BioSample database [Barrett et al. 2012] for SRA libraries
annotated with metadata describing the sample as 
  (1) human and 
  (2) central nervous system.
  
SQL query:
`SELECT * FROM tismap_summary 
  WHERE biosample_tags LIKE ‘%neuron%’ 
  AND scientific_name ‘Homo sapiens’ 
  AND percent_identity 90 
  ORDER BY coverage desc;`

From the 7,675,502 sequencing runs, 483,173 (6.29 percent) runs were annotated
as `central nervous system` samples, of which 82,454 (17.07 per cent) were
annotated as human. 

We further filtered to ‘neuron’ annotated datasets containing an unknown virus
(<90 per cent RdRp amino acid identity, detected by palmscan, 
[Babaian and Edgar 2022]). This yielded a ten matching libraries.

By contig coverage, three of the highest-expression libraries (SRR1205923,
SRR1204654, and SRR1205190) originated from one BioProject (PRJNA241125), which
we manually inspected to identify a divergent RdRp fragment (palmprint:
u150420_halalDiploma).

We term this BioProject’s associated paper ‘the Ngô study’, wherein the authors
infected three human cell types (neuronal stem cells, neuronal differentiated
cells, and monocytes) in vitro, with nine different strains of the
apicomplexan parasite T. gondii or a mock control [Ngô et al. 2017].

We assembled all 117 available Ngô mRNAseq runs de novo and with palmscan
identified a 3,202 nucleotide (nt) putative viral contig with a coding-complete
989 amino acid RdRp (see below).

A blastp search on the translated protein revealed highly divergent RdRp
homologs; the highest identity match was an unclassified Riboviria RdRp
(search date: 18 June 2023, accession: QIM73983.1, percent-identity: 54.13 per
cent, query-coverage: 40 per cent, e-value: 9e-133).

**A.** 
### A. Introduction and Identification of the Index Dataset 
Ecological analysis defines a virus by its relationship to its host (biotic) and environment (abiotic). To establish the baseline ecology for sOTU u145189, I looked at its “Index Case”, the dataset where it first appeared. The virus was identified in SRA run SRR13240068, which is part of BioProject PRJNA683720, a raw sequencing dataset from Southwest Minzu University (2020) generated within the study “Maiwa farming in plateau and plain.” SRR13240068 was used as the index case because it represents the highest-coverage detection of the canonical palmprint sequence for sOTU u145189 and provides a complete, well-annotated metadata context.

- Biotic context: According to the NCBI BioSample metadata, the host organism is the Maiwa breed of domestic yak (*Bos grunniens*); specifically, the sample is annotated as muscle tissue collected from an adult male
- Abiotic context: Although the broader study includes bovine animals from both Guanghan (plain) and Hongyuan (plateau), the index dataset analyzed here corresponds specifically to the Hongyuan high-altitude plateau group.. 
- Technical context: NCBI library annotations (RNA-seq strategy, transcriptomic source, cDNA selection) are consistent with host-focused sequencing design rather than a targeted microbial or viral profiling. 

### B. Expansion to the Broader Viral Ecology  

To place the index case in a broader ecological context, I examined the virusRunObservations.csv dataset to identify all sequencing runs containing sOTU u145189. This dataset aggregates Serratus RdRp detections across public SRA libraries and serves as the main source for ecological analysis in this project.

All rows corresponding to u145189 were extracted, and unique SRA runs, BioProjects, and associated host metadata were counted and summarized.

This screening identified 17 observations across 15 unique SRA runs distributed across 6 independent BioProjects. 

- Host Specificity: The virus is strongly associated with the subfamily Bovinae, appearing multiple times in *Bos grunniens* (Yak) and *Bos taurus* (Cattle). A single detection is annotated as human-derived.
- Geographical Independence: The detections span independent studies from China (Yak) and North America (Cattle). Critically, while the Cow Heart detections (PRJNA644042) originate from the same institution as the Index Case (Southwest Minzu University), the Cow Muscle detections (PRJNA480220) originate from the University of Alberta (Canada). This replication across completely distinct laboratories and continents strongly argues against a facility-specific contaminant.
- Tissue context: In *Bos grunniens*, detections are confined to muscle tissue, whereas in *Bos taurus*, the viral signal is detected in muscle and heart tissue, consistent with the Yak index case. Lastly, one single detection occurs in the Homo sapiens fecal dataset.

### C. Comparison to Related Viruses and Ecological Interpretation  
To assess whether this ecological pattern aligns with expectations from related viruses, I performed BLASTp analysis on the translated palmprint sequence (104 amino acids) corresponding to u145189. BLASTp analysis returns RNA-dependent RNA polymerases as the top matches. Because the query sequence is short (~104 amino acids) and aligns only to a small internal region of much larger RdRp proteins, this confirms that u145189 represents a conserved RdRp fragment (a Serratus palmprint) rather than a full-length polymerase.

- Result: The top matches were RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from Totiviridae-like viruses, including Eimeria-associated RNA viruses, with approximately 61% amino acid identity and an E-value of 9e-37.
- The paradox: Viruses in this group are most commonly associated with fungi or protozoa, rather than vertebrate hosts. This contrasts with the repeated detection of u145189 in datasets derived from ruminant animals, including samples annotated as muscle tissue.

Comparative tissue analysis: To better understand this paradox, I examined the run-level metadata for the bovine datasets to determine the precise tissue tropism. An informative distinction emerged: 
- The Index (Yak): Detected exclusively in muscle tissue (SRR13240068), establishing the baseline tropism. 
- The Broader Context (Cattle): While the parent BioProject (PRJNA480220) describes a broad "multi-tissue" study (including Rumen, Liver, and Lung), run-level verification confirms that sOTU u145189 is detected exclusively in Muscle and Heart libraries (e.g., SRR7498176, SRR12170553). The virus is notably absent from the Rumen and Liver datasets within the same cohort.

Hypothesis: Hyperparasitism of a Muscle-Dwelling Protozoan

The strict localization of the viral signal to striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac) strongly supports a parasite-associated tropism rather than a direct viral infection of the bovine host.
Totiviridae viruses are typically found in fungi and protozoa rather than animal tissues [Goodman et al., 2010]. The recurrent detection of this viral signal in yak muscle transcriptomes therefore suggests an indirect ecological association, most likely involving a protozoan host residing within muscle tissue. 

Biological plausibility: Domestic yaks (Bos grunniens) on the Tibetan Plateau exhibit a high prevalence (~95%) of Sarcocystis Infection [Tang et al., 2023]. Sarcocystis is an apicomplexan protozoan that is phylogenetically close to Eimeria [Blazejewski et al., 2015]. Given that the RdRp palmprint sequence of sOTU u145189 most closely matches Eimeria-associated viruses, this relationship offers a plausible biological context for the detection of the virus in cardiac and skeletal musculature.

Proposed Mechanism: I hypothesize that sOTU u145189 infects Sarcocystis parasites encysted within the host muscle. When muscle samples are processed for RNA sequencing, these parasite cysts are broken open, releasing viral RNA. As a result, the viral sequences are captured alongside host RNA and appear to originate from yak muscle, even though the virus itself is associated with a non-vertebrate parasite. 

The Trophic Link (Human Detection): Finally, while sOTU u145189 is predominantly detected in Bos grunniens (yak), there was a single detection in a human fecal virome dataset (PRJNA804384). Humans are the definitive host for S. hominis, acquired via consumption of infected bovine muscle [Fayer et al., 2015]. Although our viral sOTU was linked to a Yak metadata annotation, its detection in a human metagenome would imply that S. hominis (the human-infecting species) may also utilize Yaks as an intermediate host, given the host genus similarity (Bos). Thus, my interpretation is that the presence of the virus in human feces is therefore consistent with the digestive transit of a cyst-derived virus ("trophic transmission") rather than an active human infection. 

## Question 3 : Interrogate the Virus `(20 points)` ----------------------------

**Q.** `(10 points)` Research and identify what are at least 10 *features* and 
10 *observations* regarding your virus.

Ideally this section should capture 50+ one line observations, almost like a
"scratch pad" to document your thinking. If you rule something out, keep it and
mark the line with [X]. This is "bank" of accurate statements from which you will
interpret, and build your analysis upon

List or write short sentences describing those features here. Examples are:
```
# Example Answer
- [X] Narnaviruses have a DNA genome
- Narnaviruses have an RNA genome
- Narnaviruses have a single-stranded genome
- The typical genome length is between 2,200 - 3,200 nucleotides long
- Narnaviruses typically encode for a single protein, RdRp
- Narnavirus RdRp are typically 800-1000 amino acids long
- [X] Narnaviruses infect fungi, like yeast
- Narnaviruses infect apicomplexans, like toxoplasma
- ...
```
**A.** 
### 1: Intrinsic Features (Sequence, Taxonomy & Information)
- sOTU u145189 is defined by a 104 amino acid "palmprint" sequence (fragment of the RdRp).
- The extracted 104-amino acid palmprint encompasses the core structural domain of the RdRp, containing the three conserved catalytic motifs (A, B, and C). The analysis confirms the presence of Motif C at the C-terminus (residues 97–104), which houses the GDD active site essential for catalysis.
- [Feature] This region represents the highest information-density segment of the viral genome, necessary for a valid homology search based on the concepts taught in L3. 
  - Motif C contains the GDD catalytic core, which is the most invariant feature of RdRPs.[Ingrida Olendraitė et al., 2023]
- BLASTp analysis reveals top hits to Totiviridae (dsRNA viruses).
- Best hit identity is ~61% (distantly related, likely a novel genus or species).
- The E-value is 9e-37, indicating the signal is thermodynamically distinct from random noise (Lecture 1).
- [Feature] The sequence contains the conserved GDD (GDD/SDD-family) catalytic motif characteristic of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
- [Feature] The viral genome is likely linear, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), typical of Totiviridae.
- According to ViralZone, the Totiviridae lineage is listed under dsRNA viruses, which are defined as having double-stranded RNA genomes.
- [Feature] Expected genome architecture is simple and bicistronic, consisting of two overlapping ORFs encoding a Gag (capsid) protein and a Pol (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) expressed via ribosomal frameshifting.
- [Feature] Likely non-enveloped capsid (based on typical Totivirus morphology from ViralZone) 
- [X] Ruled Out: BLAST analysis showed no homology to reverse transcriptase proteins characteristic of Retroviridae, ruling out a retroviral origin.
- [X] Ruled Out: The sequence shows no homology to bacteriophage proteins in BLAST results, ruling out a phage origin.
- [X] Ruled Out: Sequence is not a Narnavirus, as it retains capsid-like associations in BLAST results (unlike the "naked" polymerases of Narnaviridae).
- Taxonomic Anchor: Closest phylogenetic neighbours are Eimeria-associated viruses.
- Taxonomically speaking: Eimeria belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa and is phylogenetically related to Sarcocystis and Toxoplasma.
- [Hypothesis] The protein is encoded by a continuous open reading frame (ORF) and contains the conserved GDD catalytic motif (…HVGDDVLC…), supporting that it is translation-competent and not a pseudogene decay product.

### 2: The Index Case Observations (SRR13240068)
- Source: Identified in SRA run SRR13240068 (Southwest Minzu University, 2020).
- Host: Bos grunniens (Maiwa Yak), Adult Male.
- Tissue: Muscle (Sample metadata lists the tissue of origin as muscle, which in this vertebrate context is interpreted as skeletal muscle.)
- Library Strategy: RNA-Seq (Transcriptomic).
- Selection: cDNA selection
  - [Inference] The library is annotated as cDNA, but the metadata does not specify the exact RNA selection method. Given that the sample derives from eukaryotic muscle tissue, it is reasonable to infer that a standard poly-A–based mRNA enrichment protocol was likely used.
- [Critical Technical Note] Totiviridae genomes typically lack Poly-A tails.
  - [My reasoning] Under a standard poly-A–selected host RNA-seq protocol, detection of this virus would be unexpected. The observed viral signal may reflect non-canonical capture via internal A-rich regions, or alternatively indicate that the library preparation used rRNA depletion rather than strict poly-A selection.
- [Uncertainty] Because the library preparation protocol is not explicitly documented, it is not possible to determine which RNA capture mechanism was responsible. However, the consistently high coverage of the viral sequence indicates that it was not effectively removed during library preparation.
- Ecosystem: High-altitude plateau (Hongyuan).
- Depth: Detection of the virus in a host-focused RNA-seq dataset indicates that it is present at a measurable level within the tissue sample.
- Read Identity: The reads map to the viral contig with high identity, ruling out a distant cross-species hybridization artifact.

### 3: Broader Ecological Observations (All Detections)
- Total Observations: 17 distinct hits in the Serratus database.
- BioProject Diversity: Found in 6 independent BioProjects.
- SRA Run Diversity: Found in 15 unique sequencing runs.
- Global Distribution: Detected in yak muscle transcriptomes from Hongyuan, Tibetan Plateau, China
- Global Distribution: Detected in independent cattle transcriptome datasets from the United States
- Temporal Stability: Detections span multiple years, arguing against a single reagent batch contamination. 
- Host Consistency: 16 of the 17 detections are in subfamily Bovinae (Yak and Cow).
- Tissue Tropism (Yak): Exclusively found in Muscle in available Yak data.
- Tissue Tropism (Cow): Found in Heart and Muscle
- [Anatomical Inference]: Although most virus-positive runs are broadly annotated as “muscle,” one dataset (SRR21537976) specifies the Longissimus dorsi, a well-defined skeletal muscle. This provides anatomical resolution that grounds the broader muscle annotations and reinforces the restriction of the viral signal to striated tissues (skeletal and cardiac). 
- [X] Ruled Out: Not detected in available bovine lung or brain datasets (suggests tissue specificity).
- Outlier: 1 detection in Homo sapiens (PRJNA804384).
- Human Sample Type: Fecal (Stool).
- [Conflict] [Conflict] sOTU u145189 (a putative dsRNA Totivirus-like sequence) was detected in a DNA sequencing library (PRJNA804384).
- [Interpretation] The Human detection derives from an MDA-amplified DNA library (SRR17932311). Since Totiviridae are dsRNA, this signal implies the sequence exists as a DNA "fossil" (EVE) or a reverse-transcription artifact, definitively ruling out an active RNA viral infection. 
- [X] Ruled Out: The human detection is not a liver or blood infection (as it is restricted to the gut lumen/feces); can rule out an active infection 

### 4: Biological Context & “Trojan Horse” Reasoning
- Host Biology: Sarcocystis cysts are intramuscular (matches Yak/Cow detection sites).
- Host Biology: Host biology: Given that Sarcocystis forms cysts in muscle, the muscle-restricted signal in cattle is expected. In humans, those cysts are digested and release bradyzoites in the gut, so a parasite-associated viral signal showing up in feces fits the known life cycle rather than indicating human infection.
- [X] Ruled Out: The virus is not a plant virus, making "dietary plant consumption" an unlikely explanation compared to protozoa.
- [Correlation] High prevalence of Sarcocystis in Yaks (~95%) aligns with recurrent detection of virus in Yak datasets [Tang et al., 2023] 
- [Ecological parallel] the system parallels the “Trojan Horse” mechanism described by [Gupta et al. 2024], in which Apocryptovirus odysseus (Narnaviridae) persists hyperparasitically within Toxoplasma gondii, a concept also discussed in Lecture 2 by Dr. Babaian. Although sOTU u145189 belongs to Totiviridae rather than Narnaviridae, it appears to occupy a similar ecological role as a viral passenger residing within an apicomplexan cyst and facilitating trophic transmission between hosts.
- Phylogeny Check: No Totiviridae are currently known to infect mammals directly [Liv Sandlund et al., 2021]. 

### 5: Interpretative Angle

- Digital Biomarker - Given its Totiviridae taxonomy and tissue-restricted detections, the virus is inferred to be obligate to a protozoan host. Viral detection therefore implies parasite presence, even when the parasite itself is not sequenced.
- Because sOTU u145189 consistently tracks Sarcocystis-associated tissues, its detection in host RNA-seq data may serve as an unintended indicator of parasitic burden in the bovine animals.
- Possible Utility: There is no need to generate new data. Thousands of bovine RNA-seq datasets are publicly available in the SRA, many of which have already been computationally screened for viral RdRp signatures by Serratus. Hence, re-analyzing these historical datasets for the viral signature can provide an easier and low-cost way to infer Sarcocystis prevalence across populations.

### 6: Summary of Uncertainty

- Uncertainty: At present, Sarcocystis is inferred rather than observed; a more guided  confirmation would come from identifying protozoan 18S rRNA [Taynar Lima Bezerra et al., 2023] in the same datasets.
- Conclusion: The combined phylogenetic, ecological, and tissue-specific evidence is more consistent with a protozoan-passenger model than with a vertebrate-infecting virus.

(A) Hypothetical Genome: Schematic of the canonical Totiviridae architecture (dsRNA, ~6 kb), characterized by two overlapping open reading frames (Gag and Pol) expressed via a -1 ribosomal frameshift (not recovered in this microassembly). (B) Observed Microassembly: The viral genome was retrieved from the Serratus microassembly pipeline, yielding a high-coverage contig (NODE_2, 1,185 nt) from dataset SRR13240068 visualized here, and an extended scaffold (NODE_1, 1,524 nt) used for downstream phylogenetic reconstruction. Viral abundance was established via mean read coverage (10.9x). The contig contains a substantial Open Reading Frame (317 aa) initiating at nucleotide 230. This ORF encodes the core RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp), containing the taxonomic 104 aa "Palmprint" domain (shaded region). The sequence is 3' incomplete.

Phylogenetic Verification of Host Tropism
To validate the host prediction beyond simple BLAST-based homology, I conducted a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. The RdRp sequence of sOTU u145189 was aligned with the RdRp sequences of the type species from each of the five recognized Totiviridae genera, capturing the established phylogenetic diversity of the family.
- Protozoan: *Giardia lamblia virus* (Giardiavirus), *Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1* (Trichomonasvirus), and Leishmania RNA virus 1 *(Leishmaniavirus)*. 
- Fungal: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A* (Totivirus) and *Helminthosporium victoriae virus 190S* (Victorivirus).

- Result: The phylogenetic analysis resolved two well-supported clades: a fungal clade anchored by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a protozoan clade anchored by Giardia and Trichomonas. sOTU u145189 clustered robustly within the protozoan clade, forming a sister relationship to the Giardia/Trichomonas lineage. This evolutionary placement supports adaptation to a protozoan host and strengthens the inference that the viral signal detected in bovine muscle originates from the parasite Sarcocystis, rather than from the bovine host itself.

The evolutionary history was inferred using a maximum likelihood approach based on RdRp amino acid sequences. Viral sequences were aligned with MAFFT, and phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using FastTree via the NGPhylogeny.fr platform. The resulting tree was visualized and annotated in iTOL. The tree is rooted using the fungal Helminthosporium virus (grey). sOTU u145189 clusters as a robust sister taxon to Leishmania RNA virus 1 (cyan), placing it firmly within the protozoan-infecting clade of the family Totiviridae.

**Q.** `(bonus 5 points)` 
  Do something creative or cool with the viral genome. The endevour should be
  creative `3 points` and yield an insight that could not otherwise be obtained
  `2 points`.

**A.** 
### Addressing the “Poly-A Paradox”
- Rationale & Hypothesis: 
An apparent inconsistency was identified in Question 3. Totiviridae are known to possess non-polyadenylated dsRNA genomes [Ghabrial, 1998], yet sOTU u145189 was recovered from an RNA-seq library annotated as cDNA-based and therefore likely enriched for polyadenylated transcripts. This observation is most consistent with non-canonical priming of the viral RNA during cDNA synthesis. Short internal A-rich regions within the viral RNA could plausibly allow incidental capture during oligo-dT–based library preparation. This mechanism, known as false priming, has been previously documented and provides a reasonable explanation for the presence of non-polyadenylated viral sequences in host RNA-seq data [Svoboda et al., 2022]. This hypothesis was evaluated by examining the viral contig for internal adenosine traces capable of mediating such capture.

- Method 1: Excluding endogenous viral elements (EVEs)
To test whether the detected sequence could represent an endogenous viral element rather than an active viral genome, I queried the viral contig against the Bos grunniens reference genome (TaxID: 30521) using BLASTn. No significant alignments to host chromosomes were observed. This result argues against our sOTU u145189 being a host-integrated genomic fossil and supports its interpretation as an exogenous viral fragment.

- Method 2: Analysis of "False Priming" Sites
To investigate how a non-polyadenylated viral RNA could be recovered from a poly-A–enriched library, I scanned the 1,185 nt contig for adenosine homopolymers (A-traces) that could plausibly anneal to oligo-dT capture probes.

Observation: Four discrete A-rich regions containing runs of four consecutive adenines (AAAA) were identified at approximately nt positions 614, 695, 921 and 1004. No canonical long A-sections (>6 nt) were found.

Interpretation: The absence of long A-tracts argues against capture via a single, canonical poly-A–like region. A plausible alternative is that multiple short A-rich motifs contributed to weak, transient oligo-dT interactions, allowing occasional retention of viral RNA during the library preparation. This implies that the library preparation conditions allowed for thermodynamically unstable interactions, where the Oligo-dT primers bound to weak internal 'AAAA' sites despite the lack of a true Poly-A tail. 

Conclusion: This analysis attempts to resolve the ecological paradox identified in Q3. It demonstrates that the observations are most consistent with a technical capture effect arising from library preparation, rather than true biological polyadenylation of the viral RNA. This suggests that dsRNA viruses can still be recovered from poly-A–selected datasets, likely as a consequence of rare, depth-dependent capture rather than true polyadenylation.

## Question 5 : Discussion `(5 points)` ----------------------------------------

Highlight for your reader what you have learned from this virus, or what novel
biological insights does characterizing this genome offers to the reader. What
facts did you find the most fascinating about your kind of virus, and did your 
virus share these traits? Even more interesting is if it _doesn't_ have a trait
known to that virus. It's always fun to push against the textbook definitions.
(3 sentence and 50 - 150 word limit)

**A.**
Characterizing sOTU u145189 exposes the gap between metadata and biology. While the datasets consistently label these samples as bovine muscle and heart, the sequence data argues otherwise: the RdRp palmprint is structurally consistent with fungal and protozoan dsRNA viruses, not mammalian ones. We shouldn't confuse the collection site with the biological host. This discrepancy supports a specific, testable hypothesis, in that this is a 'passenger' virus infecting a cryptic parasite (likely, for e.g., *Sarcocystis*) embedded within the tissue, rather than a direct infection of the yak itself. The recovery of a non-polyadenylated dsRNA signal from libraries likely intended for mRNA sequencing suggests that these datasets can still contain non-host viral sequences. This suggests that archived RNA-seq data hold untapped utility as digital biomarkers, allowing researchers to infer parasitic burden from viral proxies even when the parasite itself is not explicitly annotated.

```

**A.** 
Tweet 1: A forensic paradox: sOTU u145189 appears repeatedly in bovine (*Bos grunniens* and *Bos taurus*) muscle RNA-seq. The problem? 
1. It’s a Totiviridae RdRp (typically fungal/protozoan, not mammalian).
2. It’s a dsRNA virus (non-polyadenylated) recovered likely from Poly-A enriched libraries. Metadata largely says "Bovine." Biology says "Impossible." [Image: Figure 1 Microassembly]

Tweet 2: The Twist - The Biological Insight: The viral signal is primarily restricted to striated muscle (cardiac/skeletal), the exact tissue where *Sarcocystis* parasites encyst. The "Trojan Horse" Hypothesis: We aren't seeing a bovine virus. We are sequencing a viral passenger inside a protozoan cyst, hidden within the host tissue.

Tweet 3: The Solution (A Technical Mechanism?) Resolving the capture: How does a "tailless" dsRNA virus bypass Poly-A selection? Forensics reveal multiple internal 'AAAA' motifs (e.g., pos 614) capable of low-affinity priming. The lesson: Stochastic capture errors in library prep can inadvertently create digital biomarkers for cryptic parasitic burden.
