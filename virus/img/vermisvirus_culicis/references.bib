  abstract  = "Telomeres are composed of tandem arrays of telomeric-repeat
               motifs (TRMs) and telomere-binding proteins (TBPs), which are
               responsible for ensuring end-protection and end-replication of
               chromosomes. TRMs are highly conserved due to the sequence
               specificity of TBPs, although significant alterations in TRM
               have been observed in several taxa, except Nematoda. We used
               public whole-genome sequencing datasets to analyze putative TRMs
               of 100 nematode species and determined that three distinct
               branches included specific novel TRMs, suggesting that
               evolutionary alterations in TRMs occurred in Nematoda. We
               focused on one of the three branches, the Panagrolaimidae
               family, and performed a de novo assembly of four high-quality
               draft genomes of the canonical (TTAGGC) and novel TRM (TTAGAC)
               isolates; the latter genomes revealed densely clustered arrays
               of the novel TRM. We then comprehensively analyzed the
               subtelomeric regions of the genomes to infer how the novel TRM
               evolved. We identified DNA damage-repair signatures in
               subtelomeric sequences that were representative of consequences
               of telomere maintenance mechanisms by alternative lengthening of
               telomeres. We propose a hypothetical scenario in which
               TTAGAC-containing units are clustered in subtelomeric regions
               and pre-existing TBPs capable of binding both canonical and
               novel TRMs aided the evolution of the novel TRM in the
               Panagrolaimidae family.",

               species: passion fruit green spot virus (PfGSV). Results
               revealed that PfGSV has a positive-sense RNA genome split into

               of variability) molecules. The highest nucleotide sequence
               divergence among PfGSV isolates and other cileviruses is in the

               degenerate primers allowed the identification of negeviruses in
               four different species of mosquitoes (Ochlerotatus caspius,
               Culex pipiens, Cx. theileri and Cx. univittatus) collected in
               southern Portugal. The genomes of two of these viruses,
               sequenced to full completion, were shown to encode all the
               proteins encoded by previously described negeviruses. One of
               these viruses induces exuberant cytopathic effect in insect cell
               culture, with no obvious signs of apoptosis induction,
               replicating very rapidly and allowing for the detection of viral
               genomes in the infected culture supernatant as soon as 4h
               post-infection. This virus was also shown to use a dsRNA
               intermediate, which was found to be fully formed and active 3h
               after infection. Phylogenetic analysis of two products encoded
               by the viral ORF1 placed both viruses among Negev virus cluster,
               in the recently proposed Nelorpivirus taxon.",

  abstract  = "Insects are the host and vector of diverse viruses including
               those that infect vertebrates, plants, and fungi. Recent
               wide-scale transcriptomic analyses have uncovered the existence
               of a number of novel insect viruses belonging to an
               alphavirus-like superfamily (virgavirus/negevirus-related
               lineage). In this study, through an in silico search using
               publicly available insect transcriptomic data, we found numerous
               virus-like sequences related to insect virga/nege-like viruses.
               Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel viruses and
               related virus-like sequences fill the major phylogenetic gaps
               between insect and plant virga/negevirus lineages.
               Interestingly, one of the phylogenetic clades represents a
               unique insect-infecting virus group. Its members encode putative
               coat proteins which contained a conserved domain similar to that
               usually found in the coat protein of plant viruses in the family
               Virgaviridae. Furthermore, we discovered endogenous viral
               elements (EVEs) related to virga/nege-like viruses in the insect
               genomes, which enhances our understanding on their evolution.
               Database searches using the sequence of one member from this
               group revealed the presence of EVEs in a wide range of insect
               species, suggesting that there has been prevalent infection by
               this virus group since ancient times. Besides, we present
               detailed EVE integration profiles of this virus group in some
               species of the Bombus genus of bee families. A large variation
               in EVE patterns among Bombus species suggested that while some
               integration events occurred after the species divergence, others
               occurred before it. Our analyses support the view that insect
               and plant virga/nege-related viruses might share common virus
               origin(s).",
