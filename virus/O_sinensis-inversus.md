# Lost in Translation: The Obelisk That Found Similarity Abroad

written by: [Andrew Wong](https://github.com/amcwong)

### Obeliskus sinensis inversus

The name "Obeliskus sinensis inversus" derives from "Obeliskus," is latin for Obelisk and "sinensis," is a Latin term denoting origin from China and "inversus," meaning "inverted" or "turned upside down." This nomenclature reflects the ironic discovery that obelisk sequences from non-China regions exhibit greater similarity to the index obelisk than those from China, effectively inverting the initial hypothesis as well as the modified hypothesis that was made to fit the time constraints.

## Abstract

Understanding the ecological distribution and genetic diversity of viroid-like RNA elements is crucial for elucidating their roles in microbial ecosystems. Obelisks are circular single-stranded RNA elements found in diverse environments, often associated with microbiomes and agricultural settings. They typically exhibit conserved secondary structures and minimalistic genomes, encoding few proteins with unique functions.

Obeliskus sinensis inversus (Obelisk_001681_000001_000001), a 757-nucleotide circular RNA identified in pig farm wastewater in China, encodes a single open reading frame without known homologs, suggesting a novel protein. We investigated whether obelisk sequences from China are more similar to the index obelisk than those from non-China samples. Contrary to our expectations, as 90% of the obelisks in the O. sinensis inversus cluster were discovered in China, analysis of 2,000 sequences from each group revealed that non-China sequences exhibited higher sequence similarity to the index obelisk than China sequences. Statistical analysis using percent identity scores and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed a significant difference between the two groups (p-value < 2.2e-16). Additionally, our exploration of the obelisk's genomic features showed high conservation of RNA secondary structures and the absence of common viral motifs, reinforcing its uniqueness as an obelisk. These findings challenge the prediction that geographic proximity correlates with genetic similarity in obelisk sequences and highlight the need to consider environmental factors and host interactions in their distribution and evolution. Our study contributes to the understanding of obelisk diversity and suggests that factors beyond geographic origin shape their genetic landscape.

## Results

### Digital Ecological Observations

Understanding the ecological context of novel genetic elements is essential for elucidating their roles within microbial communities and their broader environmental impacts. Obelisk_001681_000001_000001, a newly identified RNA viroid, was discovered in multiple environmental samples, prompting an investigation into its ecological associations. This section explores the specifics of the index case and compares it with other instances of sequence-similar obelisks to identify common ecological factors and formulate a comprehensive hypothesis about its ecological role.

### Specifics of the Index Case

The index obelisk, Obelisk_001681_000001_000001, was identified in the SRA run SRR10972809, submitted under BioProject PRJNA552555. The sample originated from pig farm wastewater in Zhaoqing, China, collected on July 2, 2019, and was later associated with a publication titled 'The correlation between antibiotic resistance gene abundance and microbial community resistance in pig farm wastewater and surrounding rivers'. The researchers at the College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University created the dataset alongside the publication to investigate the correlation between antibiotic resistance gene abundance and microbial community resistance (DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109452). The data set associated with the bioproject provides insights into the microbial dynamics within agricultural wastewater ecosystems.

### Broader Ecology of Obelisk-Containing Datasets

Aside from the index case, the other obelisks and the samples they originate from, span across different ecological environments. The following paragraphs note the sample, the bioproject, the collection date, and the sequencing device as the first sentence.

Anaerobic Maize Digestion in Germany (ERR2029742), part of BioProject PRJNA479603, collected on April 21, 2015, using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. This dataset is associated with the study "Microbiome dynamics and adaptation of expression signatures during methane production failure and process recovery" by Grohmann et al. (2018).

Pig Placenta in Sichuan, China (SRR6703676), part of BioProject PRJNA433661, collected on February 9, 2018, using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. This run is linked to the publication "Transcriptome Profiling of Placenta through Pregnancy Reveals Dysregulation of Bile Acids Transport and Detoxification Function" by Wang et al. (2019).

Chicken Faeces in Various Regions of China (SRR14039706, SRR14039722, SRR14039627, SRR14039771), all part of BioProject PRJNA716119, collected between March 22 and March 23, 2021, using the HiSeq X Ten platform. These runs are associated with the study "RNA viromes from terrestrial sites across China expand environmental viral diversity" by Chen et al. (2022) and "Resolving deep evolutionary relationships within the RNA virus phylum Lenarviricota" by Sadiq et al. (2022).

Semi-desert Pond Sediment in Xinjiang, China (SRR14039725), also part of BioProject PRJNA716119, collected on March 22, 2021, using the HiSeq X Ten platform, linked to the aforementioned publications by Chen et al. (2022) and Sadiq et al. (2022).

These datasets reveal that obelisks are prevalent in agricultural and animal-associated environments, particularly within livestock waste such as pig farm wastewater and chicken faeces. Additionally, their presence in anaerobic digestion systems and sediment samples suggests a broader ecological niche that includes microbial-rich environments where horizontal gene transfer and microbial interactions are prominent.

### Commonalities and Ecological Implications

A comparative analysis of the obelisk-containing datasets highlights several common factors.

Isolation Sources: All samples originate from agricultural or animal-associated environments, including pig farm wastewater, chicken faeces, pig placenta, and anaerobic maize digestion systems. This suggests that obelisks thrive in nutrient-rich, high-microbial-density environments where microbial interactions are intense.

Geographic Distribution: Obelisks were primarily detected in China (Zhaoqing, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Hubei) and Germany, indicating a regional prevalence in areas with significant agricultural activities. The concentration in these regions may reflect common agricultural practices or environmental conditions conducive to obelisk persistence and transmission.

Sequencing Technologies: The consistent use of Illumina sequencing platforms (HiSeq 2000, HiSeq X Ten, HiSeq 2500) across all datasets ensures reliable sequencing data.

Associated Publications: The studies linked to these datasets focus on antibiotic resistance, microbial community dynamics, and viral diversity, indicating that obelisks may play roles in regulating antibiotic resistance genes and influencing microbial ecosystem functions. For instance, Yang et al. (2019) explore the relationship between antibiotic resistance genes and microbial resistance in pig farm wastewater, suggesting a potential link between obelisks and antibiotic resistance dynamics.

These commonalities imply that the obelisks in this cluster relate to components of microbial ecosystems within agricultural settings, potentially influencing nutrient cycling, antibiotic resistance propagation, and microbial community structure. Their presence across diverse yet related environments underscores their ecological significance and potential impact on both environmental health and agricultural practices.

### Formulated Hypothesis and Future Directions

Given the information about the assigned obelisk, Obelisk_001681_000001_000001, and the other obelisks in the 1681 cluster, there are a multitude of hypotheses that can be made about the ecological relationships and role of Obelisk_001681_000001_000001. Here is a specific hypothesis that will be the focus of this paper.

Hypothesis: Obelisk sequences associated with samples collected in China are more similar to each other than to obelisk sequences associated with samples collected outside China, compared to the null hypothesis that there is no difference in sequence similarity based on geographic origin.

Figure 4: Thermodynamic Ensemble Prediction Results Supporting Secondary Structure Validity
Legend:

This figure provides thermodynamic parameters predicted for the viroid Obelisk_001681_000001_000001, supporting the validity of the centroid secondary structure shown in Figure 2. Each term is explained below:

    Free Energy of the Thermodynamic Ensemble (-227.01 kcal/mol):
    This value represents the overall stability of the predicted RNA secondary structure. Lower free energy indicates a more stable structure, which corresponds to the viroid's biologically favored conformation.

    Frequency of the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) Structure in the Ensemble (0.00%):
    This denotes the proportion of the thermodynamic ensemble that adopts the MFE structure. A frequency of 0.00% indicates that no single structure dominates the ensemble. Instead, the centroid structure, which minimizes the total distance from all structures in the ensemble, is preferred for representing the RNA's most probable state.

    Ensemble Diversity (83.25):
    This metric reflects the variability among structures within the ensemble. Higher diversity suggests a range of possible RNA conformations; however, it also reinforces the validity of the centroid structure as a representative model due to its consistency with base-pair probabilities and structural features.

### Other (bonus) sections

## Hypothesis Investigation

The purpose of my analysis is to answer the hypothesis outlined in the section "Formulated Hypothesis and Future Directions": Obelisk sequences associated with samples collected in China are more similar to each other than to obelisk sequences associated with samples collected outside China, compared to the null hypothesis that there is no difference in sequence similarity based on geographic origin.

Due to time constraints, I have only analyzed their relationship to the index case obelisk. As such, the main hypothesis is now the following: Obelisk sequences associated with samples collected in China are more similar to the index case Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 than the index case is to obelisk sequences associated with samples collected outside China.

### Methods

#### Data Preparation

To test the hypothesis that Obelisk sequences associated with samples collected in China are more similar to each other than to Obelisk sequences associated with samples collected outside China, a comprehensive dataset was constructed. The datasets obelisk_sraRunInfo.csv (containing sequencing run metadata) and obelisk_clusters.csv (containing obelisk cluster assignments and sequences) were merged. A Python script added a binary attribute China to obelisk_sraRunInfo.csv, indicating whether each sample originated from China (China = 1) or not (China = 0), based on the geo_country field. This enhanced metadata was merged with obelisk_clusters.csv on the sra_run (accession) identifier, resulting in the consolidated dataset merged_obelisk_data.csv. To focus the analysis on sequences outside a potentially overrepresented cluster, obelisks associated with obelisk_cluster_id 1681 were excluded.

#### Sample Selection

From the available data, a total of 2,053 China samples and 8,727 non-China samples remained after excluding cluster 1681. To ensure balanced representation, 2,000 sequences were randomly selected from each group using stratified random sampling. This approach aims to maintain comparable sample sizes for statistical analysis while capturing a broad spectrum of sequence variability within each group and is accepted as a randomization method for bioinformatics (Rosenberg & Kumar, 2003).

#### Sequence Alignment and Similarity Calculation

The nucleotide sequences of the selected samples and the index obelisk (Obelisk_001681_000001_000001) were extracted for alignment analysis. Pairwise global alignments were conducted between each sample sequence and the index obelisk sequence using the pairwiseAlignment function from the Biostrings package in R. The validity of this alignment is supported by its usage in multiple bioinformatics and statistics research papers (Lawrence & Morgan, 2014). A nucleotide substitution matrix with a match score of 1 and a mismatch penalty of -1 was employed to appropriately score nucleotide pairings, where matches are favored and mismatches are penalized uniformly. This simple scoring scheme, derived from the tutorials, ensures that the alignment accurately reflects nucleotide conservation without introducing complexity that might obscure meaningful similarities. Gap penalties were set with a gap opening penalty of -10 and a gap extension penalty of -0.5 to account for insertions and deletions. The higher penalty for initiating a gap discourages the introduction of multiple gaps, while the lower penalty for extending an existing gap allows for alignment flexibility where insertions or deletions are plausible. Percent identity for each alignment was calculated using the pid() function, representing the proportion of identical nucleotides over the alignment length. This metric provides a quantifiable measure of sequence similarity to enable a direct comparison between the China and non-China groups

#### Analysis

Percent identity scores from both groups were combined into a single dataset for comparative analysis. Summary statistics, including mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range (IQR), were computed for each group. The Shapiro-Wilk test assessed the normality of the percent identity distributions. As both groups deviated significantly from normality (p-values < 0.05), the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the distributions between the China and non-China groups. The testing of normality and usage of non-parametric tests for non-normally distributed data is standard for analyzing the statistical significance of non-normally distributed events (Vickers, 2005). Statistical significance was determined at the conventional alpha level of 0.05.

#### Data Visualization

Box plots and histograms were generated to visualize the distribution of percent identity scores for each group. These plots facilitated the assessment of central tendencies, variability, and the presence of outliers, providing a graphical representation of the differences between the groups.

This analysis was designed to test whether obelisk sequences from China are more similar to each other than to sequences from non-China samples. By comparing the percent identity of sequences from each group to the index obelisk (originating from China), the analysis aimed to determine if sequences from China exhibit higher similarity to the index obelisk than sequences from non-China locations. The underlying assumption was that higher similarity to the index obelisk among China samples would support the hypothesis of geographic clustering of sequence similarity.

### Results

#### Sequence Similarity to Index Obelisk

The analysis included 2,000 China sequences and 2,000 non-China sequences. The mean percent identity to the index obelisk for the China group was 32.25% (standard deviation [SD] = 4.20%), while the non-China group exhibited a higher mean percent identity of 41.96% (SD = 3.90%). The median percent identity was 32.17% for the China group and 42.22% for the non-China group (Table 1). The interquartile ranges were similar between the groups, with an IQR of 6.30% for China and 6.26% for non-China sequences.

Table 1: Summary Statistics of Percent Identity to Index Obelisk
| Origin | Mean (%) | SD (%) | Median (%) | IQR (%) |
|-------------|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| China | 32.25 | 4.20 | 32.17 | 6.30 |
| Non-China | 41.96 | 3.90 | 42.22 | 6.26 |

#### Analysis

The Shapiro-Wilk normality test indicated that the percent identity distributions for both groups significantly deviated from normality (China: W = 0.98567, p-value = 2.88e-13; Non-China: W = 0.97198, p-value < 2.2e-16). Consequently, the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. The test revealed a highly significant difference between the China and non-China groups (W = 174,179, p-value < 2.2e-16), suggesting that the distributions of percent identity scores are statistically distinct between the two groups.

#### Data Visualization

The box plot illustrates that the median percent identity for the non-China group was higher than that of the China group. Both groups displayed similar variability, as evidenced by comparable IQRs. The China group exhibited slightly more outliers than the non-China group, but overall, the spread of the data was analogous.

Figure 10: Sequence Similarity to Index Obelisk by Geographic Origin

Legend:This box plot compares the percent identity of 2000 obelisks from China and 2000 obelisks from non-China regions to the index obelisk sequence. The median percent identity for the non-China group is notably higher than that of the China group, suggesting a stronger sequence similarity between the index obelisk and the non-China group. The figure explores whether the index case obelisk shows an association with obelisks originating from China, with results suggesting a weaker relationship compared to those from non-China regions.

Figure 11. Distribution of Sequence Similarity to Index Obelisk by Geographic Origin
Legend:

This histogram illustrates the distribution of percent identity between 2000 obelisks from China and 2000 obelisks from non-China regions compared to the index obelisk sequence. Percent identity is plotted on the x-axis, and the frequency of sequences with a given percent identity is plotted on the y-axis. The two distributions are differentiated by color: blue represents obelisks from China, and red represents obelisks from non-China regions.

The figure highlights a notable shift in the distribution between the two groups. The non-China group demonstrates a higher peak in percent identity, centered closer to 40%, while the China group exhibits a broader distribution with its peak slightly below 35%. The overlap between the two groups suggests some shared sequence characteristics; however, the non-China group shows a trend toward higher sequence similarity to the index obelisk.

#### Conclusions

The findings indicate that non-China sequences are, on average, more similar to the index obelisk than China sequences, as reflected by higher mean and median percent identity scores. The significant difference, denoted by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, in percent identity distributions suggests a potential geographic influence on obelisk sequence similarity.

However, the low overall similarity and the identified limitations necessitate caution in interpreting these results. The disproportionate representation of samples, exclusion of a major cluster, and potential confounding variables highlight the need for more comprehensive analyses. Future studies should incorporate a broader range of sequences, consider additional factors affecting sequence similarity, and possibly utilize multiple reference sequences to better understand the geographic patterns and evolutionary dynamics of obelisk sequences.

The significant difference in percent identity, noting greater identity for non-China sequences, strongly suggests that the index case obelisk (Obelisk_001681_000001_000001) is not more similar to other Chinese obelisks than to obelisk sequences associated with samples collected outside China.

Figure 12: Phylogenetic Tree Construction of Obelisk Proteins Using MAFFT and JalView
Legend: This figure describes the methodology used for constructing the phylogenetic tree of Obelisk proteins, focusing on the multiple sequence alignment and filtering steps performed in JalView. The default values provided by JalView for MAFFT were used, justification for these parameters can be found in the cited alignment resource (Katoh & Standley, 2013). The provided protein sequences, shown in the FASTA file, were first aligned using the MAFFT WS alignment algorithm with default parameters, which is optimized for large and highly similar sequence sets. The alignment was visually inspected in JalView to ensure accuracy and coverage, followed by sequence filtering to retain only proteins with greater than 30% amino acid identity relative to the index sequence (lcl|ORF1_Obelisk_001681_000001_000001). This filtering step removed sequences with insufficient similarity to reduce noise in downstream phylogenetic analyses.

The multiple sequence alignment revealed highly conserved regions, particularly at the N-terminal and catalytic domains, while variations were observed in loop regions and less conserved motifs. Conserved residues indicative of functional or structural significance were highlighted in the alignment visualization. The resulting alignment was exported into a Newick format suitable for phylogenetic tree construction. The tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method, employing the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix to quantify evolutionary distances. Visualization of the phylogenetic tree was performed in JalView, with branch lengths reflecting evolutionary divergence and support values calculated for key branches.

Quality: Brown bars represent the alignment quality, reflecting the degree of consistency and evolutionary significance of each position.
Consensus Sequence: A consensus sequence is shown below the alignment, representing the most frequently occurring amino acid at each position. Amino acids are color-coded by chemical properties to highlight functional motifs.
Occupancy: Gray bars below the alignment denote sequence coverage at each position, ensuring all sequences contribute to the alignment.

Functional Implications:
Large highly conserved regions, particularly at the N-terminal and central regions, suggest critical functional roles.

## Discussion

Discuss for your reader what you have learned from this obelisk, or what novel
biological insights does characterizing this genome offers to the reader. What
facts did you find the most fascinating about your kind of obelisk, and did your
obelisk share these traits? Even more interesting is if it _doesn't_ have a trait
known to that obelisk It's always fun to push against the textbook definitions.

**A.**
The characterization of Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 has provided insights into the diversity and ecological roles of obelisks. One of the most intriguing aspects of this obelisk is its minimalistic genome. With a length of only 757 nucleotides, it embodies the simplicity characteristic of viroid-like agents. The genome encodes a single open reading frame (ORF) spanning nucleotides 51 to 671, which translates into a protein of 206 amino acids. This single-ORF organization suggests a streamlined genome optimized for efficient replication and interaction with host machinery, a feature that is both fascinating and relatively rare among RNA elements of similar size.

Ecologically, Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 is predominantly associated with agricultural environments, particularly those involving livestock waste such as pig farm wastewater and chicken feces. This association raises intriguing questions about the obelisk's role within these microbial-rich ecosystems. It may contribute to nutrient cycling, influence microbial community composition, or partake in horizontal gene transfer events. The presence of the obelisk in anaerobic digestion systems and sediments further suggests adaptability to diverse environmental conditions and potential involvement in broader ecological processes like methane production.
Comparison with Obelisks in Zheludev et al., 2024

In addition to the ecological observations, the main findings from this investigation into Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 reveal notable similarities and differences when compared to the obelisks characterized in Zheludev et al., 2024.

#### Similarities

Circular RNA Structure: Both Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 and the obelisks described by Zheludev et al. possess circular single-stranded RNA genomes.

Rod-like Secondary Structures: The predicted RNA secondary structures of both sets of obelisks exhibit highly base-paired, rod-like conformations. These structures are reminiscent of viroid-like RNAs and are essential for maintaining genomic integrity and facilitating interactions with host machinery.

Phylogenetic Distinctiveness: Similar to the obelisks in Zheludev et al., Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 forms a unique phylogenetic group with no detectable homology to known RNA or protein databases. This distinctiveness underscores the novelty of obelisk sequences and their potential to represent previously uncharacterized RNA entities.

Host Associations: Both studies highlight the association of obelisks with microbiomes. While Zheludev et al. identified specific bacterial hosts such as Streptococcus sanguinis, this investigation associates obelisks with microbial-rich environments in agricultural settings. While not definitive, these associations suggest that obelisks thrive in environments with high microbial density and active microbial interactions.

#### Differences

Genome Length: A primary difference lies in the genome length. Obelisks in Zheludev et al. are approximately 1 kilobase (kb) in length, with subtypes like obelisk-ɑ extending to 1,164 nucleotides. In contrast, Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 has a shorter genome of 757 nucleotides. This discrepancy may reflect subtype-specific genomic variations or evolutionary adaptations to different ecological niches.

Protein-Coding Capacity: Zheludev et al. report that obelisks encode one or two proteins, termed "Oblin-1" and "Oblin-2," with Oblin-1 containing a conserved globular domain and Oblin-2 forming a leucine zipper structure. Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 encodes a single protein with no identifiable conserved domains. However, it is possible that the 7 alpha-helices and 2 beta-sheets figure 2 do form these structures and the tools or procedures used to verify the existence of these domains were not done correctly. Though, should there be a sincere lack of these structures, this absence may imply different functional roles or evolutionary pathways, potentially reflecting the unique ecological pressures encountered in agricultural environments compared to human-associated microbiomes.

Geographic and Environmental Distribution: While both studies report obelisks in diverse environments, Zheludev et al. emphasize their prevalence in human-associated microbiomes, such as the gut and oral cavities, with distinct anatomical preferences. In contrast, Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 is predominantly found in agricultural and animal-associated environments, including pig farm wastewater and chicken feces. This difference highlights potential ecological specialization and raises questions about the factors driving the distribution and host association of obelisks across different environments.

Ribozyme Motifs: A subset of obelisks in Zheludev et al. includes self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme motifs, which are crucial for RNA processing and replication. Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 lacks identifiable ribozyme motifs, indicating alternative mechanisms for RNA maturation and replication that differ from those observed in the obelisks studied by Zheludev et al. Though, again, it is possible that the 7 alpha-helices and 2 beta-sheets figure 2 do form these structures and the tools or procedures used to verify the existence of these domains were not done correctly.

#### Conclusions

The observed similarities reinforce the fundamental characteristics that define obelisks, such as their circular RNA structure, rod-like secondary conformations, and phylogenetic uniqueness. These shared features support the fact that obelisks constitute a distinct class of RNA elements with conserved structural and functional foundations, regardless of their specific ecological contexts.

Conversely, the differences may highlight the adaptability of obelisk sequences to diverse environments and host interactions. The variation in genome length, protein-coding capacity, and the presence or absence of ribozyme motifs could indicate that obelisks can undergo selective genomic pressures to suit specific ecological niches or functional requirements. For instance, the shorter genome of Obelisk_001681_000001_000001 and its minimalistic protein-coding capacity could reflect an adaptation to the streamlined demands of agricultural microbial ecosystems, where efficient replication and minimal host interaction may be advantageous.

The overall findings from "Question 4" indicate that non-China sequences are, on average, more similar to the index obelisk than China sequences, as reflected by higher mean and median percent identity scores as well as the statistical tests. The significant difference in percent identity distributions suggests a potential geographic influence on obelisk sequence similarity. However, the low overall similarity and the identified limitations necessitate caution in interpreting these results. The disproportionate representation of samples, exclusion of a major cluster, and potential confounding variables highlight the need for more comprehensive analyses. Future studies should incorporate a broader range of sequences, consider additional factors affecting sequence similarity, and possibly utilize multiple reference sequences to better understand the geographic patterns and evolutionary dynamics of obelisk sequences. These future studies should aim to answer the initial hypothesis rather than the hypothesis derived solely to answer a solid question given the time constraints.

Once in a lab both bright and neat,
A scientist felt the world’s heartbeat.
News spread wide of a virus new,
“An Obelisk!” the headlines flew.

Determined to act, not sit aside,
They delved into data with scientific pride.
**From the College of Animal Science’s hands,
Came the dataset from far-off lands**.

**“Pig farm wastewater,”** the records said,
“A treasure trove where this virus spread.”
Using the mighty **Illumina HiSeq 2000**,
They sequenced RNA, no detail blundered.

**In circular strands, the RNA danced,
With rod-like shapes that left them entranced**.
Not just any RNA, but something grand,
**Encodes Oblin-1 and Oblin-2 on demand**.

**Published on a chilly January day,
January 27, 2020**, they’d say.
Metatranscriptomic methods paved the way,
To understand the Obelisk’s role in play.

With each sequence and every byte,
They pieced together the viral sight.
A pandemic threat, both swift and sly,
But our scientist aimed to clarify.

Through bioinformatics and keen insight,
They worked through day and through the night.
Obelisk’s secrets began to unwind,
Revealing mysteries of its kind.

So in the lab where dreams take flight,
They battled the virus with all their might.
A hero’s journey, brave and bright,
Guided by data’s guiding light.

And as the world watched with hopeful eyes,
The scientist reached for the skies.
With Obelisk’s truths now in their hand,
They stood with their research to help save the land.

In rhythms rhymed and stories spun,
Their quest for knowledge had begun.
A tale of science, courage, and cheer,
To overcome the viral fear.
