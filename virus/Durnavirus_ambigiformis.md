### *Durnvavirus ambigiformis*
*Durnavirus* is derived from the order Durnavirales, which encompasses a variety of RNA viruses including partitiviruses.

*Ambigiformis* means "of ambiguous form" in Latin, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the virus' host range and ecological niche, as well as its ambiguous taxonomical placement based on sequence similarity analyses.

## Abstract

Virus discovery through RNA sequencing continues to uncover lineages that challenge the classical definitions of viral taxonomy. Partitiviridae comprise a family of bisegmented double stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses known for infecting plants, fungi, or protozoa [Vainio et al., 2018]. However, there remains a large number of novel viruses that remain unclassified within this family, otherwise known as partiti-like viruses. Here, we show that a novel partiti-like virus that does not fit into any established genus within the Partitiviridae family. We found that the virus ecologically resembles members of the cryspovirus genus by appearing across diverse species and geographic locations, indicating that a broad ecological distribution is not exclusive to cryspoviruses and may occur in other unclassified partitivirus-like lineages. Furthermore, analysis of the *de novo* RdRp contig revealed that when compared to other partitiviruses and other families within the order Durnavirales, it is closest to Picobirnaviridae rather than any established partitivirus genus, revealing that the virus may not fit into Partitiviridae at all, and instead may indicate a new family. We anticipate that these result will be valuable for virus discovery by highlighting the need for more sophisticated classification strategies for the growing number of unassigned “-like” viral lineages. As viruses evolve quickly and continually generate novel sequence space, methods that can resolve these ambiguous groups will be essential for keeping known taxonomical groups aligned.

## Results

**Index Case Context**

I want to first explore the index run to understand the
biological origin of the virus, including its sampling source and where it was first discovered. Using Excel to explore `data/virusRunObservations.csv`, I filtered the
data to only include rows where the `unique_palm_id` (u188789) column
matched the sOTU identifier from the index run for my virus in `data/virusAssignments.csv` to find the BioProject and publication
associated with my virus. The specific SRA run for the index case is
SRR5117445.

I found that the BioProject was PRJNA357523, which is associated with
the publication "Absence of deformed wing virus and Varroa destructor in
Australia provides unique perspectives on honeybee viral landscapes and
colony losses" [Roberts et al., 2017]. I then read the metadata for the
index SRA run and found that the RNA sequencing data was generated by
using Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology on honeybee (Apis mellifera)
samples, submitted by the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation).

The dataset originated from A. mellifera samples collected across
Australia. The study aimed to investigate the stressors affecting
honeybees independent of the Varroa destructor mite, which is a
significant factor in honeybee colony losses globally. Australia is
unique in that it does not have V. destructor, allowing researchers to
study other potential causes of colony losses while maintaining similar
agrochemical and pathogen stressors that exist in other continents [Roberts et al., 2017].

One feature that is missing from the index metadata is the specific niche of the honeybee which these runs originate from, because the origin is simply listed as “bee metagenome”. Since canonical partitiviruses are not known to infect insects directly [Vainio et al., 2017], this makes the presence of a partiti-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in a bee metagenome unusual. This pattern instead aligns closely with cryspovirus, which are partitiviruses that infect protozoa [Nibert et al., 2009], including micro-eukaryotes commonly found in environmental samples and sometimes in insect microbiomes [D'Auria et al., 2025]. This raises the possibility that the viral sequence is coming not from the bee itself, but from a protozoa instead. Because of this, my initial hypothesis is as follows:

1. I hypothesise that the virus is a cryspovirus infecting a protozoan within the bee microbiome, measured by how similar it is genomically to known cryspoviruses. Alternatively, the virus may not be a cryspovirus and instead fits into one of the other established partitivirus genera, or represents a more distantly related lineage from another family.

Following this hypothesis, identifying the contexts where the virus is detected can help narrow down if it is consistent with a protozoan cryspovirus-type. If it is a cryspovirus, the following hypotheses follow:

2. I hypothesise that the virus is sampled in a wide range of species because it infects a protozoan or micro-eukaryote that is consistently associated with these hosts. Alternatively, the virus will not appear across species, suggesting it infects a narrower host such as honeybees.

3. I hypothesise that the virus will be detectable across geographically diverse datasets because protozoan-associated viruses such as cryspoviruses often appear in many environments due to the widespread distribution of their microbial hosts. Alternatively, the virus will appear geographically restricted, implying a more specific or localised host.

To address these hypotheses of sampling sources and geographic region, I next explored the metadata of all datasets containing my virus. I
again used Excel to analyze `data/virusRunObservations.csv`. I filtered
the data to only include rows where the `node_seq` column matched
my virus's sOTU. This filtering yielded a total of 30 unique datasets
(SRAs) across 11 different BioProjects.

Due to the large number of datasets, I further filtered the data to
identify the datasets that are an exact match to the index run sequence (100%
identity). This resulted in 11 datasets across 7 BioProjects:

- SRR5418950 (PRJNA353856)
- SRR5117445, SRR5117443, SRR5117442 (PRJNA357523)
- SRR6203186 (PRJNA366365)
- SRR068399 (PRJNA52851)
- SRR9016020 (PRJNA535998)
- SRR10901293, SRR10901296, SRR10901302 (PRJNA601517)
- SRR11932623 (PRJNA637530)

By analysing the metadata of each dataset, I found that the datasets
spanned a variety of host species, including honeybees (Apis mellifera),
wetland metagenome, plant litter, woodland mosquitoes, and river water.
The geographic origins of these datasets were also diverse, including
locations such as Canada (British Columbia), the United States
(California, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, Pennsylvania) and
Australia (across all states).

The main pattern I noticed is that the datasets mostly came from environmental or host-associated metagenomes, involving insects, plants, and aquatic environments. When compared back to Hypothesis 2, this provides moderate support for the idea that the virus is appearing across multiple species because it may be infecting a micro-eukaryote that is common across these systems. This pattern matches well with what is known about cryspoviruses, which infect protozoa that occupy a wide variety of ecological niches.

For Hypothesis 3, the datasets originate from highly distant geographic regions, including Canada, the United States, and Australia. This distribution is consistent with the global presence of many protozoan groups. While this does not prove that the virus infects protozoa, it provides moderate support for the prediction that the virus is not geographically restricted.

**BLAST sequence similarity analysis**

I next wanted to investigate the virus outside of the sOTU matches by investigating its similar sequences to see if they followed the same pattern of appearing in a wide range of hosts and environments. By doing so, I hoped to infer properties of my virus that could be compared against that of cryspoviruses. I chose to use
BLASTp [Altschul et al., 1990] to search against the index sequence. I wanted to use a large
database so I could get a sense of what known viruses my virus is
related to, which is why I chose the ClusteredNR database. This database
contains a wide variety of proteins as it draws from the NCBI
non-redundant (nr) protein database, which contains nearly all publicly
available protein sequences [National Library of Medicine, 2023].

From this search, I found that the highest identity match (96.61%) was
to a protein from the partitivirus family. However, it was found to be a
partiti-like virus associated with A. mellifera (accession: XDI97936.1,
search date: December 4th 2025, query-coverage: 100%, e-value: 4e-75). This appears as a bee-specific association, but because canonical partitivirus genera do not infect insects, this actually fits well with Hypothesis 1, where the viral host is a protozoan living in or around the bee rather than the bee itself.

The next highest identity match (78.81%) was a virus identified as another
partiti-like virus (accession: WRQ64733.1, search date: December 4th 2025, query-coverage: 100%, e-value: 4e-61). The metadata for this study shows that the source is from an aquatic environment in Germany. Since protozoa are abundant in aquatic ecosystems, this supports Hypothesis 2, which predicts that the virus or its relatives should occur across different species and environmental contexts if they infect a broadly distributed micro-eukaryote.

Similarly, the third highest identity match (77.97%) was to another
partitivirus (accession: WZH59084.1, search date: December 4th 2025,
query-coverage: 100%, e-value: 6e-60) which was identified in a study of
isolating riverbank sediment in Western Australia. This is consistent with the ecology of protozoa, reinforcing Hypothesis 3, which expects the virus to appear in datasets from geographically distant regions if its microbial host is widespread.

All other matches were under 75% identity, so I decided to omit them from further analysis.

These results collectively fit the cryspovirus narrative but still provide weak support overall, since they rely on related viruses rather than direct host confirmation. Additionally, due to the broad classification of these matches (partiti-like, order Durnaviridae), it seems likely that my virus is also an unclassified variant. This fits with the idea that it does not fit into any established type or variant, which is later explored in Figure 6.

I next wanted to explore the structure of related viruses to see whether any known structural features might hint at host range or ecological behavior. If closely related viruses had structures typical of viruses known to infect bees or bee-associated pathogens, that could have supported the alternative hypothesis that the virus infects honeybees directly. However, the BLAST [Altschul et al., 1990] search against the Protein Bank Database (PDB) returned no hits.

**Serratus metadata analysis**

Since BLASTp [Altschul et al., 1990] in the ClusteredNR database only resulted in novel viruses with little information, I wanted to use Serratus [Edgar et al., 2022] to find known and annotated
viruses that are related to my virus, as well as to further
understand its host and geographical distribution.

To find related known viruses, I used the Serratus web
interface to search for the index run's SRA accession (SRR5117445) and
found that the top two family matches were dicisitroviridae and
iflaviridae with high coverage scores (both 100%) and identity scores
(98% and 96% respectively). This contrasts with the partiti-like
annotations seen in the ClusteredNR results and highlights that
family-level placement is not consistent across tools.

Within the Dicisitroviridae family, the top match was to the Black Queen
Cell virus (accession: NP_620564). This virus infects honeybee larvae
and is known to cause significant damage to bee colonies by causing
queen mortality, and shows by turning the queen bee larvae from yellow
to brown-black [Spurny et al., 2017].

In the Iflaviridae family, the top match was to the Sacbrood virus
(accession: AHL96303). This virus also impacts honeybee larvae by
killing worker bee larvae, and causes a brood pattern on the larvae. The
virus can remain viable and transmittable for up to four weeks through dead larvae, honey, or pollen [Wei et al., 2022].

Given the high-identity matches to Dicistroviridae and Iflaviridae in Serratus, the results initially appear to conflict with Hypothesis 1, since both families contain viruses that directly infect bees. However, these analyses also focus on similar viruses rather than any properties that the virus has itself. For that reason, these results provide weak support for rejecting the cryspovirus hypothesis but are not strong enough to overturn it. They instead highlight how uncertain the classification is for this virus.

I then used Serratus' palmID search [Edgar et al., 2022] to obtain a visualisation of where similar
RdRps appear globally, and what species they are known to affect. I used
the index sequence as input, and used the SRA metadata analysis tab to
learn more about the features of interest.

First, the tool outputted a geospatial distribution of related RdRps,
with different colours for different taxonomic levels (species, genus,
family, order).

![**Figure 1. Geospatial distribution of related RNA viruses (by taxonomic
level)**](img/Durnavirus_ambigiformis/geospatial_distribution.png)

From Figure 1, RdRps from related viruses appear across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. This fits well with Hypothesis 3, which predicts global presence if the host is a widely distributed protozoan.

Next, the tool outputted a breakdown of the host species associated with
related RdRps. Larger text indicates a higher percent identity to the
input sequence.

![**Figure 2. Host species distribution of related RNA viruses (scaled by
percent identity)**](img/Durnavirus_ambigiformis/host_species_distribution.png)

In Figure 2, related RdRps appear in insects, environmental samples, and various vertebrate-associated metagenomes. This widespread of associated hosts matches Hypothesis 2, which predicts a broad species distribution if the virus infects a shared protozoan rather than any specific animal host.

However, these ecological observations provide weak support for the cryspovirus hypothesis due to its strong reliance on sequence-similar viruses.

**Phylogenetic tree analysis**

I then decided to construct a phylogenetic tree to better understand the evolutionary relationship of my virus to other genuses within the Partitiviridae family, as well as other families within the order Durnavirales. If we see the RdRp sequence in the clade with cryspoviruses, it would strongly support Hypothesis 1. Otherwise, it is strong evidence to reject the hypothesis.

To do this, I first used the NCBI database to curate the nucleotide sequences of RdRps for a variety of partitiviruses and related virus families that are within the order Durnavirales. This included all five genera of partitiviridae as well as additional families (Amalgaviridae [Rubino, 2024], Hypoviridae [Chiba et al., 2023], and Picobirnaviridae [Delmas et al., 2018]) to test whether my contig might fall outside Partitiviridae altogether. The FASTA file containing all of these sequences is included in `rdrp_refs.fasta`. 

The accession numbers that are included in this file are as follows:
```
Alphapartitivirus:

```

I then used MEGA11 [Tamura et al., 2021] to align the sequences using ClustalW with default parameters. After alignment, I exported it as a .fasta file and then used an online converter [Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2023] to convert the alignment into a .phylip format for phylogenetic tree construction.

Next, I used IQ-Tree [Minh et al., 2020] to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. I ran the software with default parameters, and with the following command:

```
/bin/iqtree3 -s rdrp_refs.rphylips -nt AUTO
```

The output tree file was then visualised using FigTree [2018] to create the tree, with additional parameters set for aligning labels, including branch lengths.

![**Figure 3: Phylogenetic tree including the virus with genuses of partitiviridae and other families in Durnavirales. Virus of interest is denoted as 'NODE'**](img/Durnavirus_ambigiformis/phylotree.png)

From Figure 3, the RdRp sequence of my virus clearly does not cluster with any established partitivirus genus, creating its own clade. Interestingly, the Partitiviridae are separated in the tree, with deltapartitiviruses in particular separating from the rest of the genus. While this suggest that the tree is not perfectly accurate, it still provides evidence that my virus does not fit into any established genus, including cryspoviruses, strongly rejecting Hypothesis 1.

## Machine learning analysis

The virus is closely associated with similar viruses that are labelled as partiti-like, so it is unknown whether the virus fits into one of the five genera (alphapartitivirus, betapartitivirus, cryspovirus, deltapartitivirus, gammapartitivirus) [Vainio et al., 2018]. I wanted to explore the evolutionary placement of the assembled virus beyond what alignment-based methods like BLAST and phylogenetic methods can provide, to see whether it clusters with known cryspoviruses as predicted by Hypothesis 1, or if it instead aligns with another classification.

Using the same file from the phylogentic analysis, I then used a protein language model to generate machine learning-based embeddings of the RdRp protein sequence. I used the ESM-2 model [Lin et al., 2023], which is a transformer-based machine learning model trained on millions of protein sequences to capture their structural and functional properties. I then used UMAP to visualise the embeddings to see if our virus clusters with any of the groups we inputted. If it were to cluster together with cryspoviruses, it would greatly support Hypothesis 1. The Python script used to generate the plot is below and also uploaded in the repository as `clustering.py`.

![**Figure 5. UMAP visualisation of RdRp sequence embeddings by protein language model ESM2.** Each point represents a RdRp sequence, where closer points represent higher similarity. Each group is colour-coded; dark blue: contig NODE_4145, light blue: alphapartitiviruses, orange: betapartitiviruses, orange: gammapartitiviruses, dark green: deltapartitiviruses, light green: cryspoviruses, red: Amalgaviridae, salmon: Hypoviridae, purple: Picobirnaviridae.](img/Durnavirus_ambigiformis/umap.png)

From the UMAP visualisation in Figure 5, we can see that most virus families form fairly tight clusters, confirming that the ESM-2 model is capturing meaningful similarities within RdRp sequences. However, my viral contig does not fall near the cryspovirus cluster. Instead, it clusters most closely with Picobirnaviridae, a family traditionally associated with mammals and birds. This was surprising, because cryspoviruses infect protozoa, whereas Picobirnaviridae show a very different ecological pattern.

In the context of Hypothesis 1, this result suggests that the virus is unlikely to be a cryspovirus, further supporting the findings about its difference in genomic length. This instead points to the possibility that the virus represents a divergent lineage within Durnavirales.

When viewed within Partitiviridae, the virus is positioned between the gamma- and deltapartitivirus clusters. Since gamma-partitiviruses are fungal-associated and deltapartitiviruses infect plants, this ambiguity however does not support Hypothesis 2, which proposes a broad host association mediated by a widely distributed microorganism, because we would then expect the virus to cluster with either alpha- or betapartitiviruses instead, which infect both fungi and plants.

Overall, this machine learning analysis provides insight by further validating that the contig does not resembles cryspovirus RdRps. This suggests that the virus could either represent a novel partitivirus genus, or possibly even be part of Picobirnaviridae.

## Discussion

Although the virus initially appeared consistent with a cryspovirus based on its ecological breadth across insects, environmental metagenomes, and distant geographic regions, construction of a phylogenetic tree and genomic analysis revealed that the assembled RdRp segment did not match the expected size, organisation, or protein architecture characteristic of cryspovirus dsRNA1. This contrast between ecological signals and molecular features raised the possibility that the virus follows a very different evolutionary trajectory than a protozoan-associated cryspovirus. The machine learning-based analysis strengthened this interpretation by placing the virus far from cryspoviruses and instead aligning it with other partitivirus genuses, or even with families outside Partitiviridae, suggesting that it may represent a novel genus within partitiviruses or a previously unrecognised branch of the Durnavirales.

# Viral Short Story

```
He woke in another world beneath a sky the color of old honey, standing before a citadel carved from almond stone. A hooded archivist pointed to a rune-lit fountain. “Drink, seeker,” she said. “Within flows amygdalin, a dose that binds and tests the colony.” Francis tasted bitter almond and felt the wards shift; the city’s bacterial and fungal guilds did not stir, their sigils steady, as if the draught made no large change to their ranks.
But the viral banners trembled on the ramparts. Black Queen’s sigil dimmed, Chronic Paralysis faded, and the Deformed Wing standard dipped—each waning at certain moons, then rallying with the seasons, as if time itself were the stronger sorcerer than the brew. In the Hall of Threads, immune glyphs glowed faintly, most unchanged, their chorus restrained; the High Scribe murmured that the colony’s immune song scarcely shifted despite the draught.
Outside, winds carried pollen like whispering runes. “The path of infection is written in the year,” the archivist said, unfurling a map where dates outweighed potions. “Season governs titers; treatment nudges, but the calendar commands.”
Francis traced the coiled mark he had seen under his microscope—the RdRp spiral—now etched into the city’s gate. He understood: an RNA sorcery, subtle, persistent, bending but not breaking under almond law. When the sun rose over the citadel, he looked down at his shoes, still damp with the first drop, and knew the tale had started in a lab—yet its fate was bound to foraging, flowers, and the turning of the year.
