BREAKING NEWS: a new sheep virus is baffling scientists; new, never before seen interviews out now

Viruses are ubiquitous biological entities that shape host biology and ecosystem dynamics, yet many remain poorly characterized, especially those associated with vertebrate tissues. Totiviruses, a family of double-stranded RNA viruses, are typically known to infect fungi and protozoan parasites, often exhibiting tightly conserved replication mechanisms.

*Ovismusculus totivirae*, detected in transcriptomes of *Ovis aries* and *Capra hircus*, represents a totivirus-like sequence with a RdRp palmprint closely related to *Eimeria stiedai* RNA virus 1. Observed across multiple countries and breeds, the virus consistently appears in muscle-derived transcriptomes, suggesting a host- or tissue-specific association that is unusual for totiviruses detected outside typical parasite hosts. However, it remains unclear whether the totivirus-like sequences detected in vertebrate tissue represent true host infections, parasite-associated viruses, or artifacts of transcriptomic sequencing.

Here, we show that the virus likely infects a sheep-associated parasite, based on its strict tissue specificity and phylogenetic similarity to *Eimeria stiedai* RNA virus 1. Unlike canonical totiviruses which typically infect fungi, this sequence appears in vertebrate tissue-derived transcriptomes, revealing a nested infection pattern. Its consistent detection in muscle samples across multiple breeds and countries suggests a robust host–parasite association rather than sporadic contamination. This expands understanding of totivirus ecology to include vertebrate-associated parasitic contexts.

These findings demonstrate that livestock transcriptomes can harbor previously unrecognized parasite-associated viruses. Recognizing these nested infections is critical for accurate viral annotation and understanding host–parasite–virus interactions. By integrating ecological, tissue-specific, and phylogenetic analyses, this work provides a framework for interpreting viral signals in vertebrate datasets. It emphasizes that even well-characterized viral families can present unexpected host associations, underscoring the complexity of viral diversity in livestock systems.
