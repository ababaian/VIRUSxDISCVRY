Hello! This is a brief video on what I looked at when trying to characterize this novel partiti-like virus!

Partitiviruses are bi-segmented double-stranded (+) RNA viruses typically associated with plants, fungi, and protozoa [Vainio et al. 2018]. Here, a new putative novel partit-like virus is explored from a provided palmID. Initial BLASTp and Serratus analyses indicated that the palmprint belongs to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) segment most closely related to unclassified Partitiviridae and with only moderate sequence identity, suggesting divergence from the family. The palmprint was detected across multiple SRA runs derived entirely from human samples, unexpected considering the tropism of partitivurses. After running the palmprint against all the SRR assemblies using tblastn, a contig containing an RdRp was identified. Using MegaHit and Cap3, it was extended and analyzed once more. It revealed a highly conserved RdRp region and was then used to assemble a possible segment for Partitivirus sutilisdentis.
