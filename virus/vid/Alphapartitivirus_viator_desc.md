The curious case of Alphapartitivirus viator. The virus that was just
passing through.

Metagenomic sequencing has revolutionized virology, revealing vast
quantities of "viral dark matter" within the human microbiome, yet
determining the true host of these novel sequences remains a critical
challenge. Gut metagenomes frequently contain a complex mixture of
active infectious agents and transient dietary contaminants,
particularly members of the family *Partitiviridae*, which are
classically associated with plants and fungi but often detected in
mammalian feces. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a
novel virus, named *Alphapartitivirus viator* (SOTUu170297), identified
in the gut metagenomes of humans and captive cynomolgus macaques
(*Macaca fascicularis*). Structural prediction of the viral
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using AlphaFold 3 resolved a
canonical right-handed polymerase architecture containing the
universally conserved catalytic motifs A, B, and the GDD active site
(Motif C), confirming its classification within the *Partitiviridae*.
While *A. viator* was persistent across diverse mammalian samples,
"codon usage forensics" revealed a statistically significant adaptation
to the plant model *Arabidopsis thaliana* (CAI = 0.85; Z-score = +9.3)
and the fungus *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (CAI = 0.83; Z-score = +13.6).
In contrast, the virus displayed significant maladaptation to the human
genome (Z-score = -2.7), effectively ruling out mammalian infection.
These results suggest that *Alphapartitivirus viator* is a dietary
passenger introduced via the consumption of infected plant material. Our
findings highlight the importance of distinguishing active pathogens
from harmless dietary hitchhikers in clinical sequencing, preventing
potential misdiagnosis and improving our understanding of how diet
shapes the human gut virome.
