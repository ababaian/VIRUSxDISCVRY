### Video Description
This presentation tells the story of a newly characterized partitivirus associated with the mushroom Amanita pantherina, discovered through large-scale RNA virus screening. It combines digital ecology, genome annotation, and protein structure prediction to show how a persistent fungal virus is present across nutrient conditions but responds dynamically to host mineral stress. By integrating Serratus viromics, ORF analysis, InterPro functional annotation, and AlphaFold modeling, the work highlights both the genomic architecture of the virus and a surprising trimeric structural preference of its RdRp, illustrating how modern computational tools can reveal hidden layers of virus–host interaction in natural systems.

This presentation explores a persistent partitivirus in Amanita pantherina using viromics, genome annotation, and structure prediction, showing stable viral presence but nutrient-dependent activity and a likely trimeric RdRp architecture revealed by AlphaFold.

Partitiviruses are widespread persistent double-stranded RNA viruses of fungi and plants, yet their ecological behavior and sensitivity to host physiological state remain poorly understood. Here,  the RNA virome associated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Amanita pantherina was investigated using publicly available RNA-seq datasets generated under controlled mineral nutrient regimes, including complete nutrients, potassium limitation, phosphorus limitation, and combined stress. Serratus RdRp microassemblies were screened using a protein-guided approach to detect contigs matching a candidate partitivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The viral lineage was detected in all twelve libraries, consistent with a persistent fungal virus. While viral presence was invariant, a coverage-weighted proxy for viral abundance varied substantially across treatments, with the highest signal observed under phosphorus limitation. Structural modeling of the RdRp using AlphaFold revealed high-confidence folding in both monomeric and trimeric configurations, suggesting potential higher-order polymerase assembly. Together, these results indicate that partitivirus activity tracks host physiological state rather than treatment identity alone, highlighting how persistent fungal viruses dynamically respond to nutrient stress.
