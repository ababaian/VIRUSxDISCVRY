Insessor Salmoscalpicī bugs the Salmon Louse: the latest head-scratcher in the increasingly animal toti-like clusterfunk.

Historically, the family Totiviridae (now Orthototiviridae) was characterized by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses that primarily infect fungi and protozoa (Sandlund et al. 2021). In the last two decades, the rise of next-generation sequencing (NGS), high-throughput technologies, and viral metagenomics tools such as Serratus has driven an explosion in virus discovery (Edgar et al., 2022). As a consequence, the ever-increasing discoveries of novel toti-like viruses in animals have dramatically shifted toti-like virus classification and their host boundaries (Tighe et al., 2022). Here, we characterize Insessor salmoscalpicī, a novel toti-like virus.
Insessor was initially detected by Serratus, a tool which scans short-read sequences in RNA-sequencing datasets for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) similarity. Serratus flagged Insessor’s RdRp palmprint in 193 RNA-seq runs across six studies, most of which conducted transcriptomics on salmon louse, while one study conducted transcriptomics on salmon louse-infected salmon skin, implicating the salmon louse as the likely host species. BLASTp searches of the RdRp palmprint demonstrate similarity to a variety of animal-infecting viruses classified as Orthototiviridae and toti-like(Supplementary data 1).
To further support these findings, the Insessor genome was assembled and annotated, revealing a 7 kb genome with two overlapping ORFs encoding a putative capsid and RdRp, respectively. Genome annotation also revealed candidates for an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a slipping sequence, as well as 3’ and 5’ UTR characteristics. The Insessor RdRp ORF was phylogenetically analyzed by MUSCLE-alignment with BLASTp hit ORFs, the salmon-infecting totivirus PMCV, and NC Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A. The phylogenetic analysis revealed Insessor and its BLASTp hits are distinct from PMCV and classical totiviruses.
These findings provide strong evidence that Insessor salmoscalpicī is a toti-like virus with the salmon louse as its primary host.
