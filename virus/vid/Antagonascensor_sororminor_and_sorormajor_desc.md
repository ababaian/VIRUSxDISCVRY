The strange but true case of two sister mitoviruses.

Mitoviruses are mitochondria-replicating viruses, known to infect fungi, plants and invertebrates, with some of the simplest RNA genomes in nature. They consist of a strand of positive-sense RNA with a single open reading frame encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The mitochondrial location of mitoviruses in the cell poses a challenge for characterization, but modern tools enabling rapid metatranscriptome sequencing and analysis provide valuable new approaches to mitovirus discovery. Despite this, mitoviral diversity is largely unexplored. Here I present two putative novel mitoviruses, Antagonascensor sororminor, a mitovirus producing the shortest sequenced mitoviral RdRp to date, and Antagonascensor sorormajor, its close phylogenetic relation. Through analysis of metatranscriptomic datasets using RdRp palmprint sequences, I identified A. sororminor and A. sorormajor as a pair of conserved sequences homologous to genomes of the family Mitoviridae. The A. sororminor and A. sorormajor sequences both include complete ORFs encoding mitoviral RdRps, and despite 95.0% coding sequence identity, their RdRps share only 55.4% amino acid sequence identity, demarcating them as separate species of mitovirus. The A. sororminor RdRp is 469 amino acids in length, 93 amino acids shorter than the shortest mitoviral RdRp that has heretofore been sequenced. The characteristics of A. sorormajor and A. sororminor exhibit how divergence can occur through just a few mutations in small RNA viruses, and demonstrate the capacity of the conserved domains of mitoviral RdRps to maintain function even in greatly truncated proteins.
