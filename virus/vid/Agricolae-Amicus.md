Shark Tank pitch for the agricultural applications of a newly discovered mitovirus!

{ ---- Text Fold ---- }

Powdery mildew fungi are widespread plant pathogens that impose significant agricultural costs worldwide and are commonly controlled using chemical fungicides. However, fungal viruses have emerged as potential natural restrainers of fungal fitness, including cases where viral infection reduces host growth or virulence. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a mitovirus associated with powdery mildew using large-scale analysis of public RNA sequencing data.

Using Serratus, a global platform for RNA virus discovery, we identified a conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) signal across three independent sequencing datasets which turned out to be derived from powdery mildew related samples. De novo assembly and homology-based searches recovered overlapping viral contigs encoding a single long open reading frame consistent with a mitovirus RdRp. The longest recovered sequence encodes a \~700–770 amino acid polymerase and contains the canonical RdRp motifs A, B, and the catalytic GDD motif, confirming viral identity. Structural prediction further supported classification as a mitovirus through recovery of the characteristic RdRp right-hand fold.

Ecological analysis of the dataset from a sequenced plant supporting a fungal rather than plant host. Notably, the virus was detected in mycelial samples but not in haustorial samples at the sensitivity of available screens. Because haustoria are specialized fungal structures critical for host invasion, this apparent tissue bias is consistent with, though not proof of, a hypovirulent effect.

Together, these findings describe a mitovirus associated with powdery mildew and provide low to moderate confidence evidence that fungal viral infection may influence pathogen fitness. This work highlights the power of public sequencing data to uncover hidden components of plant–fungal–virus systems and motivates future experimental investigation into mitoviruses as potential biological modulators of crop disease.
