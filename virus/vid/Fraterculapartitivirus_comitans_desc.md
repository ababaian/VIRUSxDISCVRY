### Video Description

***A hidden, harm-free virus quietly thriving inside the South American fruit fly reveals an unseen world where survival unfolds in molecular whispers rather than outbreaks.***

*The Quiet Companion: A Hidden Virus of the Fruit Fly* is a short scientific nature documentary exploring the subtle biology of a newly characterized virus quietly accompanying one of South America’s most impactful agricultural pests: the South American fruit fly, *Anastrepha fraterculus*. Rather than focusing on dramatic outbreaks, the film highlights a rarely discussed category of viruses—those that coexist peacefully with their hosts and leave almost no trace of disturbance.

The documentary follows the discovery of a cryptic viral signal repeatedly detected across many unrelated RNA sequencing studies of *Anastrepha* fruit flies. Although these experiments were never designed to study viruses, a small and persistent fragment of viral RNA kept appearing in transcriptomes generated by multiple laboratories, across different years and biological conditions. This unusual consistency pointed toward an ecological relationship rather than contamination.

A central element of the story is the “index case”: a fruit fly transcriptome not enriched for viruses, yet containing a strong viral signal. From this dataset, a key fragment of the viral genome was reconstructed—an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the essential enzyme RNA viruses use to replicate. Even a partial sequence revealed a classic viral signature, including the conserved catalytic motif shared across RNA viruses.

To explore the virus’s identity and evolutionary placement, structural prediction tools were used to generate a 3D model of the RdRp. The predicted structure closely matched members of the *Partitiviridae*, a family of double-stranded RNA viruses known for quiet coexistence with hosts ranging from plants and fungi to invertebrates. Unlike pathogenic viruses, partitiviruses typically persist at low levels without causing disease.

Repeated detection of this virus across numerous datasets suggests a stable, persistent relationship with *Anastrepha fraterculus*. Rather than acting as an invasive pathogen, the virus appears to function as a long-term, low-impact companion, quietly replicating without disrupting host physiology. Its presence expands our understanding of hidden viral diversity shaping ecosystems in subtle ways.

Blending nature imagery, molecular biology and computational discovery, *The Quiet Companion* illuminates the hidden world of “quiet viruses.” It invites viewers to rethink what a virus can be—not all seek to dominate or harm. Some survive through cooperation, subtlety and persistence, shaping life in molecular whispers.

Viruses form vast, mostly hidden communities within animals and plants, subtly influencing host fitness, ecology and evolution. High-throughput sequencing now allows these cryptic viral passengers to be uncovered directly from public transcriptome data. Tephritid fruit flies such as *Anastrepha fraterculus* are major agricultural pests in South America, yet their RNA viromes remain poorly characterized [Scannapieco et al., 2020]. Members of the family *Partitiviridae* are small, segmented dsRNA viruses that typically establish persistent, low-pathogenicity infections and are only beginning to be recognized in insects [Nibert et al., 2014].

Here we show that a divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), sotu u979394, represents a partitivirus recurrently detected at low to moderate abundance in *Anastrepha* transcriptomes, with the strongest signal in *A. fraterculus*. Using Serratus palmprint mining, SRA microassemblies and manual curation, we recovered a single RdRp-encoding segment with canonical partitivirus motifs and mapped its occurrence across 51 sequencing runs from 9 BioProjects [Edgar et al., 2022; Sayers et al., 2024]. The virus appears consistently in host-focused RNA-seq datasets from apparently healthy flies, without association with disease or experimental treatment.

These findings support a model in which this virus, named *Fraterculapartitivirus comitans*, behaves as a persistent, low-pathogenicity infection rather than an acute pathogen or biocontrol agent. More broadly, this work illustrates how petabase-scale computational virus discovery can expose largely tolerated viromes in key agricultural pests, generating hypotheses for future studies of host–virus interactions.
