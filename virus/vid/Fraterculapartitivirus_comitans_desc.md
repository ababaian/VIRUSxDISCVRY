### Video Description

*The Quiet Companion: A Hidden Virus of the Fruit Fly* is a short scientific nature documentary that explores the subtle biology of a newly characterized virus quietly accompanying one of South America’s most impactful agricultural pests: the South American fruit fly, Anastrepha fraterculus. Rather than focusing on dramatic outbreaks or harmful infections, this documentary highlights a rarely discussed category of viruses—those that coexist peacefully with their hosts and leave almost no trace of disturbance.

This film follows the discovery of a cryptic viral signal detected repeatedly across many unrelated RNA sequencing studies of *Anastrepha* fruit flies. Although these experiments were never designed to study viruses, a small and persistent fragment of viral RNA kept appearing in transcriptomes generated by multiple laboratories, in different years, and across diverse biological conditions. This unusual consistency pointed toward an ecological relationship rather than contamination or coincidence.

One of the central elements of the documentary is the “index case”: a fruit fly transcriptome that was not enriched for viruses, yet surprisingly contained a strong viral signal. From this dataset, a key fragment of the viral genome was reconstructed—an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RdRp. This enzyme is the essential machinery that RNA viruses use to replicate themselves. Even a partial sequence revealed a classic viral signature, including the well-known catalytic motif shared by polymerases across the RNA viral world.

To further understand the identity and evolutionary placement of this virus, advanced structural prediction tools were used to generate a 3D model of the RdRp. The predicted structure aligned closely with the features of the Partitiviridae, a family of double-stranded RNA viruses known for their quiet coexistence with hosts ranging from plants and fungi to invertebrates. Unlike many well-known pathogens, partitiviruses do not cause dramatic disease; instead, they persist at low levels, replicating gently and generally avoiding harm.

Repeated detection of this virus across numerous studies and datasets suggests that it has established a stable, persistent relationship with *Anastrepha fraterculus*. Rather than behaving as an invasive pathogen, the virus appears to function as a long-term, low-impact companion, quietly replicating within the fly’s cells without disrupting normal physiology. Its presence expands our understanding of the hidden microbial and viral diversity that lives within common species and influences ecosystems in subtle ways.

This documentary aims to illuminate the hidden world of “quiet viruses”—organisms that defy the usual expectations of viral behavior. By blending nature imagery, molecular biology, and computational discovery, the film shows how large-scale sequencing and digital ecology can reveal unexpected layers of biodiversity. The story of this partitivirus demonstrates that not all viruses seek to dominate or harm. Some survive through cooperation, subtlety, and persistence.

*The Quiet Companion* ultimately invites viewers to rethink what a virus can be. In the ecosystem of the South American orchard, not all biological dramas are loud. Some unfold in molecular whispers, shaping life in ways that only become visible when we look closely enough. This film celebrates the idea that even the smallest and quietest organisms have stories worth telling—and that modern scientific tools are now powerful enough to uncover them.

Viruses form vast, mostly hidden communities within animals and plants, subtly influencing host fitness, ecology and evolution. High-throughput sequencing and computational mining now allow us to uncover these cryptic viral passengers directly from public transcriptome and metagenome data. In parallel, tephritid fruit flies such as Anastrepha fraterculus have emerged as major agricultural pests in South America, yet the RNA viromes of these species remain poorly characterized despite their economic importance [Scannapieco et al., 2020]. Members of the family Partitiviridae are small, segmented dsRNA viruses that typically establish persistent, low-pathogenicity infections in plants, fungi and some protists, and are only beginning to be recognized in insects [Nibert et al., 2014]. The presence, ecology and potential impact of partitiviruses associated with A. fraterculus are therefore unknown.

Here we show that a divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), sotu u979394, represents a partitivirus that is recurrently detected at low to moderate abundance in Anastrepha fruit fly transcriptomes, with the strongest signal in Anastrepha fraterculus. Using Serratus [Edgar et al., 2022] palmprint mining, SRA microassemblies and manual curation, we recover a single RdRp-encoding segment with canonical partitivirus motifs, and map its occurrence across 51 sequencing runs from 9 BioProjects [Sayers et al., 2024]. This digital ecology reveals a virus that is repeatedly found in host-focused RNA-seq datasets of apparently healthy flies, without association with a specific disease state or experimental treatment and without complex accessory gene content characteristic of acutely pathogenic RNA viruses. Our results therefore support a model in which this virus, which we name Fraterculapartitivirus comitans, behaves as a persistent, low-pathogenicity infection of Anastrepha fraterculus rather than an obvious natural biocontrol agent. More broadly, this work illustrates how petabase-scale computational virus discovery [Edgar et al., 2022] can expose previously unrecognized, largely tolerated viromes in key agricultural pests, providing hypotheses for future experimental tests of how such “cryptic companions” might modulate host biology and pest management strategies.
