### Abstract

Viruses are frequently discovered not by targeted virology studies, but as unexpected signals buried within large-scale sequencing datasets from humans, animals, and the environment [Edgar et al., 2022. Increasing use of high-throughput RNA-seq and metagenomic surveillance has revealed a hidden diversity of RNA viruses associated with fungi, plants, and complex microbial communities [Shi et al., 2016]. Partitiviruses, in particular, are double-stranded RNA viruses traditionally thought to infect fungi and plants, yet their genomic signatures occasionally appear in surprising contexts [Ramaswamy et al., 2022; Ghabrial et al., 2015].

The present study addresses the question of whether homologous viral polymerase sequences detected in two vastly different sequencing datasets—a human thyroid tumor transcriptome and a bat urine environmental virome—represent contamination, convergent assembly, or an unrecognized viral lineage.

Here we show that both datasets contain full-length, structurally conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes that phylogenetically cluster within fungal Partitiviridae and share near-identical catalytic cores. Using ORF prediction, motif mapping, phylogenetic inference, AlphaFold2 structure prediction, and Foldseek structural homology analysis, we demonstrate that the two RdRps exhibit conserved A, B, and C motifs, high structural similarity (TM-scores ≥0.89), and strong alignment in the palm domain, despite their very different ecological origins.

These findings reveal that partitivirus-like sequences can appear in both clinical and environmental sequencing libraries, challenging assumptions that such detections necessarily represent laboratory artifacts or host-restricted viruses. More broadly, the results highlight how large public sequencing datasets contain overlooked viral diversity with unclear ecological boundaries. Systematic re-examination of human tumor transcriptomes and wildlife surveillance datasets may uncover additional members of this cryptic lineage and clarify their true biological hosts.
