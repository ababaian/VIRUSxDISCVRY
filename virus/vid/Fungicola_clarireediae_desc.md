Follow Nour and Vanya as they discover a virus that could help Terry the turf grass system.


Advances in high-throughput sequencing have brought viral discovery to a new age, 
revealing vast unexplored viral diversity in both environmental and clinical samples. 
However, this introduces a new challenge: characterizing these viruses and understanding
their biological significance. Mitoviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA 
viruses (genome size lies between 2151 and 4955bps (Jacquat et al., 2023) that infect 
the mitochondria of fungi, encoding only a single protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp), which is essential for viral replication (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2023). Here 
we show the identification and characterization of a novel mitovirus, Fungicola 
clarireediae, incidentally discovered within RNA-sequencing data from the plant 
pathogenic fungus Clarireedia homoeocarpa, which causes dollar spot disease in 
turf grass systems. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that Fungicola clarireediae 
clusters closely with mitoviruses infecting diverse plant-pathogenic fungi, and 
structural comparisons via AlphaFold and FoldSeek demonstrate high conservation 
of the catalytic RdRp domain with Erysiphales-associated mitovirus 1 and Ophiostoma 
mitovirus 6. These findings suggest that mitoviral infections may be endemic to 
fungal plant pathogens and functionally conserved across diverse hosts. Our work
expands the known diversity of fungal mitoviruses and provides a framework for 
investigating viral-host interactions that could inform novel strategies for 
managing fungal diseases in economically important plant systems.
