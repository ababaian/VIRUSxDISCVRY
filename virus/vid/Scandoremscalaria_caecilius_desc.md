Are you a PyMol hater? Try ChimeraX! This tutorial makes protein structure analysis feel more familiar with an R interface to ChimeraX.


Scandoremscalaria caecilius (S. caecilius) is a novel Narnavirus that may infect parasites of the family Trypanosomatidae. S. caecilius adds to the limited characterization of Narnaviruses that infect Trypanosomatidae. With a simple variant effect predictor, DeMaSk, and AlphaFold predicted strucutures, we suggest that the newest variants of S. caecilius will have variants in the N and C termini of their RNA-dependent polymerases. S. caecilius presents a new avenue of research into preventing Trypanosoma infections and its variant effect prediction may guide the discovery of more novel Narnaviruses derived from S. caecilius.
"Structure is function" is one of the first things I learned in biology class. These results come from an understanding of S. caecilius's RdRp structure, which was analysed using ChimeraX. Come along with me as I analyse the RdRp of S. caecilius in a reporducible, less painful way.
