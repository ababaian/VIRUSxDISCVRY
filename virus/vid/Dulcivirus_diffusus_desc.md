### Video Description
This oral presentation delves into the idea of "viral residency," where viruses 
can persist across various organisms beyond infection, genome integration, or contamination, as passerby "relics."
Here, Esther walks through the discovery of _Dulcivirus diffusus_, a novel narnavirus, and how 
its genome and structure suggest its mode of residence: by infecting plant-associated fungi, or even plants directly,
and spreading through interacting organisms via environmental deposition.

This video is an oral presentation walking through the discovery of the _Dulcivirus diffusus_ narnavirus, its structure and characteristics, and mode of residence.


Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that can serve as pathogenic drivers of various infectious diseases across all kingdoms of life. Classifying viruses by their hosts, pathogenicity, and mode of transmission can yield critical insights into various disease mechanisms and more broadly the understanding of interactions between biological life. Recent advancements in genomic sequencing and high-throughput, computational analyses have allowed for an explosive expansion of viruses detected across biological samples. However, what remains unclear is the discernment between direct, indirect, and passerby viruses with regards to infection and pathogenesis, as their ability to persist across several biological specimens without direct infection can easily be overlooked. Here we show the characterization of a novel virus called _Dulcivirus diffusus_ and provide strong evidence supporting its classification as a fungus-infecting narnavirus that passively resides in non-fungal species. Initially detected in human HeLa cells containing HPV-positive exosomes, the virus was detected across several unrelated studies in fruits, plant leaves, plant fungi, bees, and mites by its unique palm signature. The broad distribution of _D. diffusus_ across taxa despite their host being seemingly restricted to plant-associated fungi strengthen the idea that viral residence can be mediated by environmental deposition and not necessarily limited to two extreme ends: direct integration or contamination. We anticipate this work to help expand the use of computational tools in a multi-faceted yet streamlined manner to readily make nuanced distinctions of viral residence for thousands of novel viral discoveries.
