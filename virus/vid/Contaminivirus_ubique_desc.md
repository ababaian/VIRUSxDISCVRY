### Video Description
What if a virus stopped infecting living cells and started infecting laboratory experiments instead?

In this presentation, forensic biologist Jay reveals the investigation into Contaminivirus ubique (C. ubique), a mysterious viral sequence that has infiltrated sequencing labs worldwide. What began as a misplaced protein in a high-profile diabetes study led to a global audit, exposing a systemic contamination event hiding in plain sight.

Key Discoveries:

- The Anomaly: Detection of a fungal virus (Totiviridae) in purified mouse immune cells, paired with inexplicably high fungal DNA.

- The Forensic Hunt: How genome reconstruction and a global data search traced the source not to biology, but to the lab supply chain.

- The "Abiotic Signature": The shocking finding of 100% identical viral sequences appearing in unrelated experiments across the globe—a fingerprint of industrial contamination, not natural evolution.

- The New Definition: How C. ubique challenges the textbook definition of a virus by spreading through sterile reagents instead of living hosts.

This talk is crucial for researchers in genomics, microbiology, virology, and anyone who relies on sequencing data. Learn why C. ubique must become a new quality control standard and how to protect the integrity of your data from this invisible, global contaminant.

Case of Viral In-Kit-Uity: Defining the Global Contaminant RdRp Marker Contaminivirus ubique as a Totivirus-like Kitome

A foundational challenge in viral metagenomics is distinguishing genuine biological signal from pervasive laboratory contamination[11]. We performed a forensic investigation on $\text{SOTU}$ $\text{u148308}$, an uncharacterized $\text{RNA}$-dependent $\text{RNA}$ $\text{Polymerase}$ ($\text{RdRp}$) fragment initially identified in mouse $\text{RNA}$-$\text{Seq}$ data[20]. Our analysis confirms $\text{u148308}$ possesses the canonical GDD catalytic motif of $\text{Totiviridae}$, a family of $\text{dsRNA}$ mycoviruses.
Given the biological impossibility of a fungal virus replicating in a mammalian T-cell sample, we advanced the conservative forensic hypothesis: **The detection of the $\text{u148308}$ sequence in non-fungal sequencing libraries is an artifact of contamination, which will establish a stable, near-perfect identity profile ($\mathbf{98\%-100\%}$ nucleotide identity) that is originating from the reagent source.** To test this, we systematically queried the sequence against 16 disparate public sequencing projects (over 150 BioProjects total), spanning host kingdoms from Mammals to Fungi and sequencing strategies from $\text{RNA}$-$\text{Seq}$ to $\text{mNGS}$[12-24]. ($\mathbf{98\%-100\%}$ ID) across numerous projects compromised by contamination, such as those from $\textit{Homo sapiens}$ and $\textit{Malassezia}$-associated environments, confirming the hypothesis[1]. Conversely, matches in complex environmental and fungal samples were significantly more divergent ($\approx 93\%-96\%$), representing naturally occurring sister strains[1]. Crucially, the $100\%$ identical sequence was detected in sensitive $\text{SARS}$-$\text{CoV}$-$2$ patient sequencing despite the primary fungal host being absent, proving its stability as naked nucleic acid in commercial reagents. This work fully characterizes $\text{u148308}$ as the Type Strain of a new $\text{Totivirus}$ lineage—Contaminivirus ubique—and provides a critical marker for diagnosing and filtering reagent-borne viral contamination in sequencing datasets globally.
