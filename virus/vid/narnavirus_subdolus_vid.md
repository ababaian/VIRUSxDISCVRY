The discovery of *Narnavirus subdolus* with the tsetse fly-trypanosoma system.

The tsetse fly–trypanosoma system is responsible for the transmission of African trypanosomiasis, but there is limited research about RNA viruses associated with it. This study computationally characterizes a previously unknown narnavirus that was detected in transcriptomic datasets from both tsetse flies and trypanosomes, consistent with a viral presence within this vector–parasite system. A partial viral genome recovered from one of the datasets revealed narnavirus-like features, including a single open reading frame encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Although phylogenetic analysis suggests the virus is insect-associated, sequencing coverage was substantially higher in *Trypanosoma brucei brucei*, indicating that the parasite is the more likely host. These findings highlight the challenges of assigning viral hosts in tightly linked biological systems and demonstrate the need for experimental validation.
