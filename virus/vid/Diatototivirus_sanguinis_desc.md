RNA viruses are increasingly discovered directly from high-throughput sequencing datasets, revealing hidden diversity across both parasite-associated and environmental microbiomes. Large-scale mining of public transcriptomic data, such as the Serratus platform, enables sensitive detection of divergent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) “palmprint” motifs. Here we attempt to investigate the genome and evolutionary placement of a novel Serratus-defined virus (sOTU u127045) whose RdRp palmprint was detected across 21 SRA runs spanning 11 BioProjects, primarily derived from human blood-related samples and a smaller number of mouse samples. We show that targeted searches of Logan assembly contigs with tblastn identified only seven short matching fragments from six runs, all nested within a single 387 bp contig (SRR17932408_60971), with no evidence of contig extension in assembly graphs. The contig had no detectable nucleotide homology by BLASTn, yet its longest predicted ORF (124 aa) produced significant BLASTp similarity to toti-like RdRp proteins, especially diatom colony–associated dsRNA viruses, motivating the provisional name *Diatototivirus sanguinis*. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on the partial RdRp region placed D. sanguinis as sister to an environmentally derived toti-like virus (*Ripuyond* virus) rather than clustering within human parasite-associated *Leishmaniavirus* lineages. These results suggest that a highly divergent, toti-like viral fragment can be repeatedly detected in mammalian blood-associated sequencing runs while retaining closest detectable protein-level similarity to environmental, algae-associated viruses. Although limited by partial genome recovery, this work highlights both the power and the ambiguity of motif-based virus discovery and pushes future efforts to recover complete genomes and determine host association.
