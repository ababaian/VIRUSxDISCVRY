### Image Description

The thumbnail features a split layout summarizing the project's central paradox. On the left, text reads: "Metadata says, 'Bovine Muscle,' BUT viral sequence reveals a cryptic protozoan passenger," followed by the project title "Unmasking sOTU u145189 via Forensic Ecology." On the right, two images illustrate the investigation: the top image displays the AlphaFold 3D protein structure of the viral polymerase (RdRp) with catalytic motifs highlighted in red, blue, and green; the bottom image depicts the ecological setting, showing Maiwa Yaks grazing on the green pastures of the Tibetan Plateau.
