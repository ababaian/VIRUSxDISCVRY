### Image Description

The thumbnail features a split layout summarizing the project's central paradox. On the left, text reads: "Metadata says, 'Bovine Muscle,' BUT viral sequence reveals a cryptic protozoan passenger," followed by the project title "Unmasking sOTU u145189 via Forensic Ecology." On the right, two images illustrate the investigation: the top image displays the AlphaFold 3D protein structure of the viral polymerase (RdRp) with catalytic motifs highlighted in red, blue, and green; the bottom image depicts the ecological setting, showing Maiwa Yaks grazing on the green pastures of the Tibetan Plateau.

One-line Captivating Description: A forensic investigation unmasks a "Trojan Horse" virus hiding in archival yak transcriptomes, revealing a hidden parasitic ecosystem.

This project investigates sOTU u145189, a viral sequence initially annotated as originating from bovine muscle tissue, and demonstrates through phylogenetic and structural analysis that it instead represents a virus associated with a cryptic protozoan host. By combining RdRp motif analysis, AlphaFold structural predictions, and ecological context from yak transcriptome datasets, this work illustrates how archival sequencing data can hide complex parasitic interactions. The findings highlight the importance of forensic ecology approaches for correctly interpreting viral metadata and better understanding hidden host–virus relationships.
