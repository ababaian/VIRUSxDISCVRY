## Tutorial Objectives:

```
You may want to read through the Project Outline first, and then pick up here.

The goal of this tutorial is for you to *play with your virus*. In terms of data
science we simply want to explore the possible space of meaningful analyses
and get a sense of direction. It's meant to be informal so as not to impede the
exploratory process, but do not mistake the lighthearted tone with a lack of
scientific rigor. The point is to sketch the space for you to make your "happy
mistakes" in, so you avoid them on your project.

That being said, the primary rule for this tutorial and your assignment is
                               
                         _good luck, have fun :)_
```

Set-up:

```
## Story preamble:

Francis was used to working late, but this was rough. As he was pipetting 
Sample 31337, the glare of the rising sun blinded him, and instinctivly his grip
tightened. A single drop of the sample fell past his bench unnoticed, soaking
into his converse.

This was the beginning, but the significance of this day would not be felt
until months later, and by then it was too late. Everything changed...
```

## Question 1 : Data Exploration `(5 points)` ----------------------------------

**Q.** For your assigned Obelisk, take the perspective of a journalists ask:
  
  - `(2 point)` *What* kind of agent is it?
  hint 1: What are the requirements for the formal 
          classification of a new virus or viroid?
  hint 2: How can you quickly compare your sequence
          to a collection of known sequences and obelisks? (hint: do it)
  
  **A.** TODO

- `(1 point)` *Who* generated this dataset and is there a publication associated
with the sample?
  hint: What does the `SRR`/`ERR`/`DRR` accession code refer to?
  hint: What is a bioProject?
  
  **A.** TODO

- `(1 point)` *Why* was this dataset generated? Science experiments are done 
(mostly) with purpose. Try to understand the motivation
behind the dataset and can the discovery of a virus in this
sample-context add something to the story?
  
  **A.** TODO

- `(0.5 point)` *How* was the data generated? Technically, what kind of data is
it?
  
  **A.** TODO

- `(0.5 point)` *When* was the dataset generated?
  
  **A.** TODO

## Question 2 : Follow the lede `(6 points)` -----------------------------------

**Q.**: Based on your set of answers in Question 1. Listen to the music.

Brainstorm 5 meaningful questions `(2.5 points)` about your virus, formulate a
hypothesis for each one `(2.5 points)` and then rank-order the questions
`(1 point)` in order of High-Priority (rank 1) to Low-Priority (rank 5), justify
the rank order by beginning to answer the questions by **any means available**.

"Meaningful" in this context means I am asking you to make a judgement call and
prioritize 5 questions from the space of infinite possible trivial questions.
The implicit goal is to help you build experience in prioritization. Include a
justification unless you are certain the question is highly meaningful.

hint: Don't just look at one "run", but try and put together a story linking
multiple datasets together into a cohesive story. There are commons factors,
identify and prioritize them.

hint: To get to the bottom of this virus, act like a detective and follow the
trail left by it. Ask questions which will help you piece together a whodunit.

## Question 3 : Data storytelling `(4 points)` ---------------------------------

**Q:**: Continue the `Story Preamble` in the style of a *niche genre*, chosen
from the list below. Write a 200-350 word short story about your assigned virus
which incorporates *5 facts* you have uncovered about the virus. 

In your story, **write the 5 factual components in bold like this** to distinguish
it from the fantastic elements.

Genre Choices
- [ ]  Indoamerican myth
- [ ]  Renaissance fairytale
- [ ]  A 1950s futurism infomercial
- [ ]  Logs of a 17th century pirate
- [ ]  Sword+sorcery high-fantasy 
- [ ]  Cyberpunk noir
- [ ]  Robert Frost poem

**A:**

TODO
```

**Q.** `(bonus)` Create a generative AI cover image for your story and include
your prompt text. The image _must_ incorporate an artistic style from a specific
period, material, artist, or genre of visual art. Add the `.png` (or `.jpg`,...)
to your submission repository named `00_cover_art.<format>`.

## Question 4 : `VIRUSxDISCVRY` Repository `(5 points)` ------------------------
- [VIRUSxDISCVRY GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ababaian/VIRUSxDISCVRY)

We will collectively be building a public Virus Discovery repository which will
collect and curate tutorials for web-tools which could be used as part of the
MGY441 Final Project.

**Q.** `(5 points)` Choose a report from the "Virus Index". Read one of the 
student reports from last year, and evaluate if the student included a hypothesis
(it was not mandatory last year) `(2 points)`. Does the hypothesis contain the 5
components we discussed, if not generate one and/or identify the 5 components
of a hypothesis from the available information `(3 points)`?
  
  ## Question 5: Reflect `(1 point)` ---------------------------------------------
**Q.** Did you have fun? (Wrong answer is not giving an answer)

**A.** TODO
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Maybe, why?
