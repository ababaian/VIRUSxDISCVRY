# {BLASTp (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for proteins)}
written by: [allanhu] (https://github.com/lorda6)

[10 minute] BLASTp is a bioinformatics tool designed to compare a protein sequence against a database of protein sequences. It works by finding regions of local similarity, giving them a score, and identifying potential homologs. For virus discovery, BLASTp is critical in identifying viral proteins by matching unknown sequences to known viral protein databases, revealing evolutionary relationships or functional insights.

**Tutorial Objective**: We will learn how to use BLASTp to compare the potential viral protein sequences to the database, as well as doing the analysis.

## Input / Prerequisites
- Access to PLASTp (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins)
- Link to example data (img/template/ao.fa)
- {What are the required inputs for the tutorial. Include example data here if applicable or link to the data as above.}
- {Are there any specific system or other requirements needed?}
- ...

## Output

{A text description of the expected OUTPUT generated by this tool, it's file format, and possibly a brief statement of it's utility.}
